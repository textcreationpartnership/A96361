            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> Preface to Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the Scriptures, more proper to that part of Scriptures here ſpoke to, then to many others, becauſe that our Saviour evidently ſhews by his practiſe that the Scriptures, nay, one Book, nay, very few Chapters of that Book is able to anſwer all Satans temptations: and as for the times wherein we live, I wiſh that Diſcourſes of the perfection, perſpicuity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Scriptures were leſs pertinent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> You ſpeak much of the Miniſtery and of the Written Word, but theſe are needleſs in our daies, or at leaſt the written Word is not the only Rule whereby we ſhould walk; Is it not plainly propheſied of the time of the Gospel, <hi>Jer. 31.34. They ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them,
<pb facs="tcp:119918:5"/>ſaith the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Iſa, 54.13.</hi> and thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and if ſo, what need Scriptures or Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> We will firſt take the words in your ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that all ſhall be taught immediatly of God without the Scriptures or Miniſtry of the Word, ſo that from the greateſt to the leaſt every one ſhall know the Lord, that is, ſo much of God as is needfull to ſalvation: Then thus I argue, That as far as can be proved by theſe words, the Scriptures and Miniſtery of the Word is needfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this Propheſie be fulfilled in this ſenſe, for there are abundance of ignorant perſons amongst us who are not taught of God, and that do not know the Lord; Many there are that do not beleeve in Chriſt, which they ſhould certainly do if God did inwardly teach them, <hi>Joh. 6.45.</hi> Now 'tis ſo evident that few there are that beleeve and by conſequence are taught of God, that it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be bewailed then proved.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Can any one imagine that none of Gods People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chriſts time, or in the Apoſtles time, were taught of God, and yet what is more evident then that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word and reading of Scriptures was in uſe, and commanded in thoſe times? Therefore to be taught of God doth not exclude the Miniſtery of the Word, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther include it: Therefore I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That to be taught of God is to be taught of God in his Word, which I prove by ſeverall places of Scripture, <hi>1.</hi> as our Saviour ſaies, <hi>He that hears you, hears me, and he that hears me hears him that ſent me,</hi> Matth. <hi>10, 40.</hi> Luk. <hi>10.16.</hi> Joh. <hi>13.20.</hi> and it is evident that the People of God have thought ſo, that they have been taught of God in the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Act. 10.33.</hi> and therefore you muſt not oppoſe thoſe things that are coordinate, and our Saviour explains this very place, that it is to be taught of God in his Word, for Chriſt makes to hear and learn of the Father to be the meaning
<pb facs="tcp:119918:5"/>of thoſe words, for hearing ſignified the outward, and learning the inward teaching of God, for if by hearing an inward hearing ſhould be meant, then it were all one with learning.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> If theſe words are to be taken in your ſence, it doth more clearly argue, that private inſtruction and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence are needleſſe, then that the Miniſtry of the Word is ſo, for in private conference and inſtruction, every one is more properly ſaid to teach his Neighbour then in the Publike Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>5.</hi> You of all people ſhould leaſt ſpeak againſt the neceſſity of preaching, ſince by your practice you are ſo far from judging it unfit for any one to preach, that you judge it fit for every one that will to preach; If preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be fit why do you condemn it? if not why do you uſe it?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> This place is a Prophecy of abundance of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the times wherein his Prophet lived were ſuch, that as in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> if any one comes to know the Truths of God, it muſt be by private conference and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as it were one Neighbour teaching of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the publique Preaching of the Word, there are none but falſe Prophets, that are Teachers amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> It is not unworthy conſidering, whether this may be the meaning of the place, <hi>viz.</hi> That in theſe ſad times the People were ſo generally addicted to Idolatry, and miſled by the falſe Prophets, that few there were that knew whether <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> was the true God, but the Prophet tels them, that concerning that Point, to know that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the Lord, <hi>the time ſhall come that they ſhall not need inſtruction,</hi> as if one ſhould ſay, that the time ſhould come in <hi>Turky,</hi> that no one ſhall need to teach them whether Chriſt or Mahomet be the true Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anabap.</hi> But is it not plainly ſaid that ye have an
<pb facs="tcp:119918:6"/>

               <hi>Authour.</hi> If the meaning of the place ſhould be, that none need to teach them, the Apoſtle would ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf, for why does the Apoſtle write this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to them if they knew all things, and need not that any man ſhould teach them?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> 'Tis againſt the whole current of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to interpret theſe words of the immediate teaching excluſively to the Miniſtry of the Word, is evidently contrary to the current of the Goſpel: What need we pray that God would ſend Labourers into his Vineyard? What need <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Creete</hi> to ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in every City, if in Goſpel-times the Miniſtery were needleſs? And that it is not only needfull for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion but edification, is evident, <hi>Act. 20.32. 2 Tim. 3.17. 1 Pet. 2.2, 3.</hi> And that the Ministry is to continue to the end of the world, is as evident; Our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth <hi>to be with his Apoſtles to the end of the world,</hi> with them, as to their perſons, he could not be to the end of the world, becauſe they died, but with their Succeſſors he was, is, and will be, <hi>Eph. 4.11, 12, 13</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The meaning of the words are, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Do not you imagine the truth you have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you have learned of man only, for 'tis the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Spirit of God that hath anointed you, that hath taught you, whoſe teachings are ſo true, and ſo full, that you need not that any man ſhould teach you upon this account, as if there were ſome defect. As if you had not been taught all things neceſſary to ſalvation, So there are three things that the Apoſtle would prove to them in thoſe words. <hi>1.</hi> That what they had learned was not properly from man though by man, but from the Spirit of God. <hi>2.</hi> That the Spirit of God had not been defective as to Neceſſaries in his teachings of them. <hi>3.</hi> Much leſs that the ſpirits teachings were falſe, as the ſeducers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:119918:6"/>and the words are ſet down, clearly in reference to their ſeducers. The words immediatly going before the <hi>28.</hi> and <hi>27. ver.</hi> the Apoſtle clearly ſpeaks concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeducers who told them that they were all this while miſled, and ſo the Apoſtle ſaies, that theſe things I have written unto you, concerning them that ſeduce you, for that 'tis plain thoſe paſſages are to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not concerning their Teachers but Seducers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anabapt.</hi> But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaies expreſly, <hi>2 Pet. 1.19. That we are to take heed unto the word of Prophecy until (and no longer) the day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe,</hi> that is, while we have the Spirit of God to teach us we are to uſe the light of the Scriptures, but afterward the light of the Spirit is to guide us, which is more and certain then that of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> By the Day-dawning and Day-Star riſe in our hearts, cannot be meant that light and thoſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit which every Saint hath as ſoon as he is regenerated, for 'tis evident that thoſe to whom the Apoſtle writ this Epiſtle, were illuminated and ſanctiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the holy Ghoſt, as appears by the first Verſe, yet the Day-Star in the Apoſtles ſenſe was not riſen in their hearts. <hi>2.</hi> 'Tis as evident that as great Revelations as any that you Anabaptiſts can boaſt of, are leſs certain then the Scriptures, not only to others but even to them who have thoſe Revelations; for the Apoſtle ſaies, that we have a <hi>more ſure word of Propheſie;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the word is not only more ſure to you that have not thoſe viſions which we have had but even for us alſo. <hi>3.</hi> Suppoſe the Dawning of the Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to be taken for the illumination of the Spirit, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that after we are ſo illuminated by the Spirit we need not reade the Scriptures; for the word <hi>until</hi> doth not alwaies refer to the time paſt, as to exclude the time to come, as <hi>Mat. 5.18. Mat. 12.20. Mat. 28. laſt. 1 Tim. 4, 13.</hi> Can you argue and ſay, that when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb facs="tcp:119918:7"/>ſhall paſs away then the Word of God ſhall fail? or Chriſt will break the bruiſed reed and quench the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax, when judgement is brought forth to victory? or that Chriſt will not be with his Diſciples and other faithfull Miniſters any longer then while the Word laſt? or that <hi>Timothy</hi> need preach no more after once <hi>Paul</hi> had been with him? and indeed in common ſenſe if I bid a man stay in a place untill I come, I do not then bid him go away, but rather ſtay longer that I may ſpeak with him, or do ſomething elſe when I come? So Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bidding the diſperſed <hi>Hebrews</hi> attend to the Word, till the Day dawn, doth not bid them then caſt away the Word, or leave it off; but however he would have them attend to it till that time, and then afterward they will of themſelves attend it without his exhortation; nay, 'tis obſervable that in that very place he preferres the Word before the ſight if the transfiguratioin of Chriſt, ſo that the Word hath the precedence ev'n of Revelation hnd Viſions. But becauſe that this point will be ſhortly ſo exactly cleared, I will omit further purſuing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> You ſpeak concerning the reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as if that were the way to keep people from errour; Whereas indeed that hath been the cauſe of all the errors of theſe times, that every one hath been ſuffred to reade and expound the Scripture. People ſhould ſtand to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and traditions of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour. 1.</hi> That every one ought to reade the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not only Clergy-men, as you call them, but all others, is ſo evident, that there is no way for you to keep men from beleeving this truth, but by keeping of them from reading the Scripture, <hi>Deut. 6.7. and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up, and thou ſhalt binde them for a ſign upon thine hand, and they ſhall be as frontlets
<pb facs="tcp:119918:7"/>between thine eyes.</hi> 'Tis evident that the King is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have as much of the Scripture by him as then was written, and he ſhall reade therein all the daies of his life, that he may learn the fear of the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law and theſe Statutes to do them; and <hi>Pſ. 1.3. Joh. 5.39. 1 Theſ. 5.27. Eph. 3.3, 4. Neh. 8.2, 3, 4, 5. Act. 15.21. Rev. 1.2. 2 Ki. 23.3. Deu. 31.11. Rom. 1.7. Act. 8.28.</hi> But if you would not have us to reade the Scriptures, how would you have us know the Truths of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts. The Prieſts lips are to preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> The words are, <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge,</hi> it ſhews their duty what they ſhould do, but 'tis apparent in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> that they did not do ſo, <hi>Ye have departed out of the way, ye have cauſed many to ſtumble,</hi> and how frequently doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Judge what I ſay, Try all things, 2</hi> Tim. <hi>2.7. 1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5.21.</hi> We having ſpoken juſt before, that we <hi>ſhould not deſpiſe Prophecy,</hi> he ſubjoyns, That we ſhould not idolize Prophecy neither, by taking every thing upon truſt that is preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But it ſhows a great deal of arrogance and pride, for poor, common, ignorant people to queſtion the doctrine of the learned and pious Miniſters, eſpecially when 'tis not only the judgement of one but of more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; eſpecially of ſuch as have been approved; it is fit for them to judge of the expoſition of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> It is very convenient and neceſſary they ſhould ſo do, and certainly ſuch ſhall have praiſe of God; for 'tis plain the Scripture praiſeth the <hi>Bereans</hi> for doing ſo; <hi>Act. 17.11. Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, and <hi>Sylas</hi> an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list preached among them; But they took not their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon truſt, but preached the Scriptures to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe things were ſo, and though they found that to be true which they preached according to the Word of God
<pb facs="tcp:119918:8"/>this day, yet they examined their preaching this day alſo, and ſo <hi>toties quoties,</hi> and theſe <hi>Bereans</hi> clearly are commended for thus doing; nor doth this argue any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs in us to receive what is preached, nor diſlike of the doctrine, for the <hi>Bereans</hi> did receive it with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of minde: though they like the doctrines never ſo well, as tis plain they did, for they heard it with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, yet they durſt not receive it before they had examined whether 'twas according to the word of God or no: and ſuppoſe our Trachers ſhould miſguide us, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that not only they but we ſhould periſh with them, <hi>Matth. 15.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But I muſt return again to that which is ſo apparent, that it cannot be denied but that in theſe times wherein every one hath been ſuffered to reade and expound the Scriptures as they pleaſe, errours, hereſies, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, have more abounded then ever they did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> I grant that for every one to be ſuffered to divulge and preach the Expoſitions, muſt needs be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means of propagating and multiplying errors; But the fault is not in their reading and knowing, but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their ignorance of the Scriptures; for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour plainly ſets down that to be the reaſon of our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and the taking things upon the credit of our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers only, our Saviour ſets down to be the reaſon of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors among the Jews; How many times doth our Saviour ſay in <hi>Mat. 5. You have heard that 'twas ſaid,</hi> whereas indeed there was no ſuch thing ſpoken in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But how is it poſſible that ſimple, ignorant people ſhould underſtand wherein there are ſuch depths, that the learnedeſt man in the world cannot fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> Can any one imagine that the Scripture was writ only for learned men and great Scholars? many things there are hard to be underſtood there is no queſtion
<pb facs="tcp:119918:8"/>of it, but thoſe things that are neceſſary to ſalvation are plain. Certainly the Scripture it ſelf ſaith ſo, <hi>Pro. 1.4.</hi> that 'twas written for that purpoſe, <hi>to give the young and ignorant underſtanding;</hi> and the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to <hi>buy the Truth,</hi> and the <hi>ignorant man hath a price in his hand,</hi> the fault is not in his head but heart; and he that hath any underſtanding, wiſedom is eaſie to him, <hi>Prov. 17.16.</hi> even very children might learn it, <hi>Deut. 6.7.</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If the Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that periſh, whether they be learned or unlearned:</hi> And if for that reaſon men ſhould not reade the Scriptures, becauſe they ſavingly underſtand them not, and abuſe the Scriptures to the maintaining of hereſies, then the reading of Scripture ſhould be alſo prohibited to learned men, for <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> or are <hi>Goſpelliz'd,</hi> as the word ſignifies, and God doth reveal the Myſteries of ſalvation to thoſe that are ſimple, and hides them to the wiſe, <hi>Mat. 11.25.</hi> and the greateſt hereticks that ever were, were not ſimple but learned men. <hi>3.</hi> If thoſe that are ſimple and unlearned, muſt not reade the Scripture, this as if thoſe that were ſick ſhould not uſe Phyſick; for ſince the Scripture only is able to make them wiſe to ſalvation, the Pſalmiſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo plainly ſaies, that the Law of God maketh wiſe the ſimple, <hi>Pſa. 19.7. &amp; 119.130.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſt.</hi> The Scripture with traditions and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Expoſition of them are neceſſary, for how can you know the Scriptures to be the Word of God but by the Traditions of the Church? if that had not preſerved and delivered it unto you, how could you ever have had the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour. 1.</hi> I would deſire you to conſider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate <hi>Meanders</hi> you would have them walk in, whom you deny to have underſtanding enough to go in the plain and pleaſant paths of the Word of God; if they ſay We muſt beleeve the Scriptures accerding to the Expoſition
<pb facs="tcp:119918:9"/>of the preſent Roman Church, then how ſhall one know whether that Church be the true Church? If you ſay By ſuch notes, univerſality, ſucceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then what an endleſſe work do you put theſe men whom you call ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people upon, <hi>viz.</hi> reading over all Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Fathers, to ſee whether that ſucceſſion you pretend be ſo or no? beſides how doth it appear whether thoſe notes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality and Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that you give of the Church be true Notes or no, If you ſay? By the Scripture, then you make the Church to be known by the Scripture, and not the Scripture by the Church, as you pretend, 'tis as if you ſhould deſire to know whether your Gold were weight or no; If you ſhould ſay when he brought his weight, how do I know whether the weight be a right weight? If it ſhould be anſwered, If the weight weighs juſt as much as your gold 'tis right; may he not juſtly anſwer, If I bring my Gold to be tried by your weight, I can receive no ſatisfaction at all if your weight muſt be tried by my gold? Beſides thoſe places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſet down the notes of the true Church, and Gods promiſes of preſerving of it in the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which you quote for the proving that we muſt be ruled by the Church, and that yours is that Church; Thoſe I ſay, your very quoting proves that you will have them read and judged of by Lay-men, and why then not other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture alſo? are not other places as eaſie to be underſtood as they, nay, far more eaſie, eſpecially in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls, both for Doctrines and practice?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As for Traditions they are wonderfull uncertain, <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe there are divers Traditions that are very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and very falſe. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> reports, that it was a conſtant Tradition in his time, <hi>lib. 1. Stro. Clemens</hi> I ſay, who lived about <hi>14.</hi> hundred years ago, reports, That it was an Apoſtolicall Tradition that Chriſt preached but one year; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that condemns this as hereticall, ſets down another as a conſtant Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:119918:9"/>as falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was delivered by Saint <hi>John,</hi> That Chriſt was very near <hi>50.</hi> yeers old when he died. Nay there was a Tradition that was as old as the time betwixt our Saviours Reſurrection and Aſcention: It was generally reported by godly precious Saints, and from the mouth of Chriſt (as they pretended) that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not die, and the miſtake aroſe by the leaving out or miſinterpreting but of one ſyllable; Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>If I will,</hi> and the Report went, <hi>I will that thou come;</hi> Abundance of other inſtances which are to be found almoſt in every one of the Fathers that lived near Chriſts time. <hi>3.</hi> There is abundance of diſagreement on the Traditions of the Fathers, for that which one Father accounts Apoſtolicall, another accounts hereticall. <hi>4.</hi> This is no new practice, for 'twas in all ages the cuſtom of falſe Prophets and Hereticks to pleade Traditions, nay, by their Traditions to make the Word of God of none effect, as <hi>Mat. 13.</hi> and if you ſhall ſay ſo, Hereticks make uſe of Scriptures; but as for Scriptures we are on all ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it is a true rule, and nothing ought to be taught contrary to it, and we have the example of our Saviour and the Apoſtles for proving doctrines by Scripture. <hi>5.</hi> You Papists do not give us a Catalogue of Traditions, and indeed thoſe that you call Apoſtolicall Traditions, wherein you differ from us: 'Tis a very eaſie thing to prove you the very yeer, or at leaſt the Century when they firſt ſprang up, but you uſe to amuſe and ſilence poor ſimple people by putting upon your error the glorious titles of Apoſtolical Traditions and practice of the Primitive Church which you know they are not able to contradict: in ſaying of our Religion that it began in <hi>Luther,</hi> in <hi>K. Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> daies, as if one ſhould ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law was no ancienter then in <hi>Joſias</hi> times, becauſe it had lain hid many years before, and was then newly revived. <hi>6.</hi> The wickedneſſe of your forgery appears in this, that though you pretend the current of antiquity for th
<pb facs="tcp:119918:10"/>innovations, yet you being conſcious to your ſelves of the falſeneſs of this pretence, have appointed an <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius,</hi> and in your new Editions of the Fathers, have left out all things that make againſt you, and then no marvell that Antiquity ſeems to be folly, when you make it speak what you pleaſe, and hinder it from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever is contrary unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But though you ſpeak ſo much againſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is it not evident that you have the Word of God by Tradition? for as you cannot know but by Tradition, that one whoſe Name was <hi>Seneca</hi> wrote thoſe Books that go under his Name, ſo you cannot know that this was the Word of God, had not you received it from the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> As a Carrier that brings a Leteer from a friend, 'tis not his ſaying that it comes from ſuch a friend that is my main argument to make me beleeve it, but I know his hand, and know the matter that he writes to be ſuch that none could write of but he, becauſe none elſe in the world knew that buſineſſe but only he; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that though he ſhould bring me a Leteer to which my Friends Name was ſet, and he ſhould write of the ſame buſineſs, yet I ſhould know that it came not from my Friend by the hand and ſtile; and if he knew not the ſecrets between my friend and I, he would have divers miſtakes concerning the buſineſſe he wrote of, by which I ſhould diſcover that the Letter came not from my friend notwithſtanding his Name was ſubſcribed; ſo for the Scriptures, though the Church delivers them to us as from God, yet that matter is of that nature, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> holineſs, conſent, depths of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and diſcovering all the ſecret corruptions of ones heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know it to be the Word of God by theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, diſcover the <hi>Alcoran</hi> not to be the Word of God, though the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> that delivers it to me ſay 'tis; and as for <hi>Seneca</hi> this is clear, In caſe I were ſure that there was ſuch a one as <hi>Seneca</hi> lived, and that thoſe

            <p>Wo unto you Jeſuites, Papiſts, Hypocrites, for you worſhip the Images and adore the reliques of the Saints, who were ſlain in the Primitive Church, and ſay that had we lived in thoſe daies we would not have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with him in the bloud of the Saints, the Martyrs of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and yet you that call your Pope his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Head of the Church, who is a rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Synagogue of Satan; you that call your ſelves the only true Catholiques, I ſay, he and you though you
<pb facs="tcp:119918:11"/>Pretend ſo much to honour the dead; It's yet you have been and are the greateſt Perſecutors living upon the face of the Earth; ſo that all the bloud that ever was ſhed by <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, is but a ſmall thing compared to that Chriſtian bloud, which you have ſhed for you have made your ſelf drunk with the bloud of Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus: therefore you Serpents, you ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vipers, how will you eſcape the Damnation of Hell, <hi>Rev. 18.24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtian Reader.</hi> I deſire a little ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, which though it ſtumbles not me, yet it ſtumbles many others. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Papiſts are very charitable, ſtrict-lived people, much given to faſting, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very liberall in maintaining of their Miniſters, adorning of their Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> Suppoſe 'twere ſo that they give all their goods to feed the poor, yet might they do all that out of hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt. Read.</hi> But why ſhould you judge their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ends, and grounds, upon which they give their alms, ſince that is becoming a Judge of evil thoughts which the Apoſtle condemns?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour.</hi> Though I ſhould not judge them, that they give their alms out of hypocriſie, yet I have much leſſe warrant to venture my ſoul, for that if they be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites they muſt be damned, which I do if I take up my Religion upon the account of their charity. But</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Are they charitable? ſo are we, for ſet aſide your Monaſteries, Nunneries, and ſuch Superſtitions we can ſhew as great, and as many works of charity as they can.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> But ſhall we account the Papiſts ſuch charitable good people, when they are the cruelleſt bloudieſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that live upon the earth, witneſſe the Gunne-Powder Treaſon, the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris:</hi> Beſides all the bloud that is ſhed in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:119918:12"/>they go, and thoſe late Maſſacres in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they were generally betraied and murthered by thoſe Papiſts which were their moſt intimate and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Friends.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> And ſurely we have but little hold of their Love and good Natures, who are bound by their Religion to imbrue their hands in our bloud again, as the Pope Commiſſions them ſo to do, and that will be as ſoon as ever he gets but power to do it. As in all places where he hath power he either damns their ſouls if they turn Papiſts, or ſlaies their bodies if they refuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtian Reader.</hi> But what may be ſaid as to their ſtrict lives, Faſting, Praying Prieſt not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authour. 1.</hi> Though ſome of their lives are in ſome meaſure unblameable in reſpect of the Duties of the Second Table, yet in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. where the whole Countrey are Papiſts, their Lives are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, their Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, and Prieſts, being generally and notoriouſly known to be guilty of ſuch Predigies of Luſt, ſuch as were ſcarce ever heard of, as Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> in his <hi>Speculum Europae,</hi> hath both judiciouſly and faithfully ſet down: A Book very worthy to be read, for he that ſhall reade that Book and beleeve that Revelation to be true, cannot but he ſatisfied of the ſubtleties and abominations of Popery, and 'tis almoſt impoſſible for any one, which is not exceedingly prejudiced, not to beleeve it to be true: It is written with ſo much candor, impartiality, gravity and judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The things wherein their ſtrictneſſe do moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, are of that nature, That the more ſtrict they are the more abominable: for thoſe things wherein they do place ſo much devotion, the Apoſtle calls <hi>Doctrines of Devils, 1</hi> Timothy <hi>4.1, 2.</hi> and if they are liberall to their Prieſts and adorning of their Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119918:12"/>'Tis no marvell then, Fellow-Idolaters that have gone before them have been as liberall as they; We reade of thoſe that pulled their Ear-rings, <hi>Exod. 22.</hi> and of thoſe that laviſhed Gold out the Bagges, <hi>Iſa. 46.</hi> 'tis not enough to releeve one in the Name of a Prophet; <hi>Paul</hi> was of a ſtricter life and converſation then any of the Papiſts, at that very time when he was Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, and amongst the Philoſophers the <hi>Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts</hi> even amongst the Turks; there are Hermites that live with as much outward auſterity as any amongſt the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, Suppoſe that you ſhould know one that were very charitable to the Poor, and liberall to the Miniſters, but was a common known Strumpet, would you account ſuch an one a Religious Woman? much leſſe ſhould you account Papiſts to be Religious though they be never ſo Charitable to the Poor, ſince they live in continuall ſpirituall Whoredome, <hi>viz.</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is farre worſe then bodily Whoredome, but the moſt ſure Preſervative againſt Popery and all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, is that which I began and ſhall conclude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>viz.</hi> Reade, Study, Meditate, and keep cloſe to the Word of God, and do not ſatisfie your ſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Reading ſo many Chapters a day, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, digeſt, and practiſe them; nay, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely with the underſtanding of thoſe Truths that lie plain and open, within the ſurface of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you reade, but digge deep and ſee what lies within the Bowels of the Text, for in the Scripture to that the words may relate, are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſedome and Knowledge: That God is the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, lies open and plain in the very words, when they are read: but this Truth That the Body ſhall riſe again is as truly contain'd, though not as manifeſtly expreſſed in the words, and our Saviour ſaith, that they underſtood not that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb facs="tcp:119918:13"/>upon that very ground, becauſe they underſtood not this Truth included in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was proved by that Text: and ſo I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen]</hi> Immediately, there were no <hi>diſſeminata vacua</hi> in the performances of our Saviour; Chriſt did ſometimes reſt, but was never idle, if you referre it to the former verſe the laſt of the third Chapter, the point is this, After great ſpiritual conſolations or viſions, we ſhould do well to expect great trials and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, which are laid upon us, leſt by ſuch revelations or comforts we ſhould be exalted above meaſure; ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. If we conſider this with that which followeth, the obſervation is, 1. In reſpect of us, that God uſeth to fit us for great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, with great temptations. 2. In reſpect of Chriſt, that from the beginning of our Saviours undertaking the work of our redemption, all was full of trouble and miſery, the devil oppoſeth the beginning of good works, and we ſhould learn from him to reſiſt the beginnings of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus was led]</hi> 1. To ſhew that he did not reſiſt, he was not drawn but led, <q>We may learn willingly to follow the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit, not to refuſe to follow God into affliction,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119918:14"/>temptation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> 2. It ſhews that he did not go himſelf into temptation. We ſhould not run into temptation, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the devil, and he will ſlee; but neither may we call him forth to battel, nor purſue him when he flies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the Spirit]</hi> The Spirit, that is, the holy Ghoſt, for if by the Spirit ſhould be meant the devil, it ſhould runne thus; He was led by the Spirit to be tempted of him, and that our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatours take it ſo is plain, it is written with a great <hi>S,</hi> for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the whole Bible when Spirit is printed with a great <hi>S,</hi> the holy Ghoſt is meant: as the Tranſlators imagine, one may be led by God into temptations, for elſe it were needleſſe and improper to pray God not to lead us into temptation, for we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deprecate things that are impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into the wilderneſs]</hi> This was not the wilderneſſe of <hi>Judea,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> preached; for there were locuſts and wilde honey, ſo that Chriſt need not have faſted for want of food. 2. When it is meant of that wilderneſſe, it is alwayes added of <hi>Judea;</hi> but when it is ſpoken without any addition, it is meant of the wilderneſſe where the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were fourty years.</p>
                  <p>But why thither to be tempted? 1. Becauſe that was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt place for that temptation, which he firſt was to be tried withall, <hi>viz.</hi> hunger, for there was no food, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.33. 2. Becauſe there he was alone: 1. Becauſe the devil might have full opportunity and liberty to tempt him. 2. To ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that victory, none other had any hand in it, for he was alone and without any aſſiſtance, he overcame the devil: that which we may learn from this is, That by being alone one gives the devil opportunity to tempt one, take heed therefore of being alone: but if you ſhall ſay, Doth not our Saviour adviſe us to be alone, to enter into our cloſet and ſhut the door, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. all meditation, private prayer, and reading would be taken away by this advice? I anſwer with our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.32. So if thou haſt the company of God, and art in his preſence by meditation and prayer, or any holy duty, thou art not alone, therefore the advice ſtill ſtands in force, be not alone, but be ſure that when thou art corporally alone, thou be not ſpiritually alone, but by holy thoughts have God in thy company. 2. Learn from hence the way to overcome divers temptations, Art thou alone, and doth Satan ſet upon thee by melancholy thoughts, or luſtful thoughts? humbly, fervently, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire almighty God to aſſiſt thee, and go into ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and do not ſtay to grapple with the temptation: this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119918:14"/>thou ſhalt finde in theſe caſes the ſafeſt remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be tempted]</hi> The reaſons why our Saviour was tempted, were not the ſame for which his members are tempted; for they are tempted, 1. Sometimes to humble them, and that they may not after great revelations and conſolations be exalted above meaſure, ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. To make them ſee that their ſtrength is not of, nor from themſelves. 3. To purifie and cleanſe them, for none of all theſe reaſons was our Saviour tempted; but 1. That he might be touched with, and bear all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities that were without ſin. 2. That he might overcome Satan in all his wayes and vanquiſh him at every weapon. 3. That no man be he never ſo holy may think himſelf free, but expect and provide for temptation. 4. As for caution ſo for comfort, that no man may judge himſelf out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, becauſe he hath grievous temptations. 5. That he might ſhew us by his example how to demean our ſelves in, and how to overcome temptations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the devil]</hi> Some take the devil here to mean the Prince of the devils, for ſo in ſome places it is taken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. the devil and his angels; and likely it it that the chief of the devils might undertake himſelf a buſineſſe of ſo great difficulty, and conſequence; our Saviour was not capable of ſome kinde of temptation, he could not be tempted of the fleſh, for all ſuch temptations argue original ſin, and that one is compounded of the fleſh and of the Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>And when he had faſted]</hi> Four kindes of religious faſts we reade of, 1. Propitiatory faſts to take vengeance of our ſelf for ſome ſinne we have committed. 2. Caſtigatory faſts to ſubdue the body and keep it under, leaſt it ſhould make us too prone to the luſts of the fleſh which may be thought was the meaning of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>I chaſtize my body.</hi> 3. Preparatory faſts when we have any great work to do in the ſervice of God, to prepare our ſelves to it by faſting, as before the receiving of the Sacrament, and to faſt and pray before ones childe be baptized, for that end alſo are Ember-weeks. 4. Devotionary faſts, when out of the raviſhment of our ſpirits we forget to eat our bread, this kinde of faſt (if any of thoſe that had been named) may this of our Saviours ſeem to be, but it may be it was rather a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119918:15"/>faſt partly neceſſitated upon our Saviour, not as if he did not faſt willingly, but that he muſt needs have faſted, unleſſe he would have wrought a miracle to eat, and this it may be was done that he might ſuffer the temptation from the fleſh as far as might be without ſinne, or at leaſt give occaſion to the devil to tempt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourty dayes]</hi> The faſt of our Saviour did exceed the faſts of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted but he was in the Mount, in the ſpecial preſence of God, and ſuſtained by the eſpecial and immediate hand of God, but our Saviour by the ſtrength of his humane nature, the temperature and conſtitution of his body was ſo ſtrong, and ſo even the reaſon why he faſted ſo many dayes might be, becauſe he would not be inferiour to any that went before him, in any duty of religion. Since therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted ſo long, he alſo would faſt no leſſe while: for the reaſons which are brought for the number, they are ſuch as ſhew more invention then judgement, one might finde out farre more then as yet are found out; but it were <hi>magno conatu nihil agere,</hi> why he faſted no more then fourty dayes before he was hungry, might be, that he might not do any thing that might give occaſion to think him not to be man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And fourty nights]</hi> This is added leſt haply ſome might think, that our Saviour faſted as we generally faſt, for when we keep a faſt, we abſtain only from refection all day, but eat our Supper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And after that he was an hungry]</hi> All that while he was not hungry, and therein very likely he differed in his faſt from <hi>Elias,</hi> and from others; all that faſt almoſt for any while are hungry: but why was he afterwards hungry? 1. To ſhow himſelf to be man, and that he bore all our infirmities. 2. It might be that he might be fitted for that temptation, and that he might as much as could be without ſinne, be tempted with all manner of temptations that we are, for there was no other way for him to be tempted from the fleſh, then by hunger and thirſt, as I ſaid before, and indeed they are the ſtrongeſt of all, and moſt there is to be ſaid, why we ſhould yeeld to them, then to any other deſire of the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the tempter]</hi> He is called the tempter, 1. Becauſe he was the firſt tempter. 2. The cunningeſt tempter, he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the woman in Paradiſe, and ſtill his buſineſſe is to tempt the children of God: but why ſhould the devil delight in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting, and making men ſinne? The reaſon is evident, for he being quite contrary to Almighty God, the very end of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is contrary to the end of Gods actions, the end of Gods actions <hi>ad extra,</hi> is his own glory, and the good of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, now apparently God is diſhonoured when any man ſins. 2. For the good of the creature, eſpecially man, and becauſe the devil knows no way to hurt man ſo long as he is in Gods favour, he ſtrives by tempting him to ſinne, to put him out of Gods favour: from this may be obſerved that he that tempts any man to ſin <hi>ſupplet vicem diaboli,</hi> and takes upon him the office of the devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coming unto him]</hi> We read not of his coming to him before, Why did he not? 1. Was it not becauſe he had ſtrong preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, that he was the ſon of God, and ſo God, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it was in vain for him to tempt him? for as long as he faſted, and was not an hungry he had no argument againſt his Deity, but upon his hunger he had, and then he tempted. 1. Howſoever, before he hungred, he could not have that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of tempting him, for as long as one is not hungry, one will not ſeek means, much leſſe unlawful means to get food; therefore he ſtayed while he was hungry, before he would tempt. 2. His coming, Is it not to diſtinguiſh the manner of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation from the former? for he was tempted of the devil all the fourty dayes he faſted, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> plainly makes mention, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. but thoſe temptations were of another nature, and the Scripture ſpeaks little of them what temptations they were, all that gives light to gueſſe at them, is <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. where it is ſaid that he was with the wilde beaſts, it may be the devil might provoke the wilde beaſts, to runne upon him as if they would devour him, likely it is that whatſoever they were, they were not ſo much for our inſtruction, as theſe are, nor for imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if the wilde or venemous beaſts did threaten him with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119918:16"/>deſtruction, his carriage, which as it is likely was not ſtirring to avoid them, is not ſit for us to imitate. 3. It is ſuppoſed (and I do not know why it ſhould be very improbable) that the devil came in the ſhape of a man, the better to deceive him, for if he ſuppoſed him to be man only, he might alſo juſtly ſuppoſe him to be fallible, and that coming in ſuch a ſhape he might not be diſcovered, it is very probable it was in ſome viſible ſhape, for elſe it could not ſo properly be ſaid coming. 4. It is ſaid coming, it may be to ſhow the difference between the tempting of our Saviour, and the devils tempting of other men: for other men, the devil may, and often doth tempt either by troubling their humours and temperature of the body, as alſo by putting ſtrange phantaſmes into the brain; now all that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could do to our Saviour, was from without, he could not otherwiſe tempt him, <hi>The Prince of this world hath nothing in me, John</hi> 14.30. 5. Coming, that is, when he was come, for he did not ſay ſo, before he came unto him: the Queſtion may be, How Satan knew that our Saviour then hungred? I anſwer, 1. By our Saviours ſeeking for food, it may be: or, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man ever faſted longer: or, 3. Becauſe Satan being a ſpirit knows the ſeveral diſpoſitions of our inward parts, and therefore knows when the parts languiſh for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when upon this want, they draw the veins, and the veins the liver, and the liver the miſeraick veins, and ſo at laſt when the ſtomack is gnawed, which gnawing the ſtomack we call hunger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſaid unto him]</hi> With an audible voice, for he did not, as ſometimes he doth to us men, inject any ſuch thought in him, and cauſe our Saviour to think with himſelf, If I am the ſon of God, why ſhould not I make theſe ſtones bread?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If thou art the Sonne of God]</hi> The Queſtion is, Whether the devil knew our Saviour then to be the ſonne of God? For, 1. If the devil did know him to be the ſon of God, how could he chooſe but think it altogether impoſſible that he ſhould ſinne, and ſo in vain to tempt him? 2. How could he chooſe but think him God, ſince he knew the ſtrangeneſſe of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he being of a Virgin was that <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and alſo the Angels called him Lord, Chriſt, the Lord? Yet the other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, That the devil did not then know our Saviour to be God, and that now he takes the beſt way he can to finde it out, whether he was or no. If the main thing the devil drives at, is to breed in us a doubt of our ſonſhip, and make us to think
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119918:16"/>our ſelves not to be the children of God, and you ſee he uſeth that twice in the next temptation alſo; three main temptations there are in theſe words, 1. Of vain-glory, he would have him do a miracle to manifeſt and ſhew his excellency, for every man he knew would be willing to magnifie himſelf. 2. Every man is willing to ſatisfie his hunger. 3. Of deſpair of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as if he ſhould ſay, thus long you have faſted, and you ſee God hath not took any way to relieve you, relieve your ſelf and wait no longer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Son of God]</hi> Four wayes there are to be the ſon of God, 1. By eternal generation, that is, the moſt excellent of all. 2. By perſonal union, when the manhood is married to the Deity, ſo we account thoſe our ſons who are ſo by marriage. 3. By regeneration. 4. By adoption; the firſt two wayes Chriſt according to his Divinity and humanity was the ſonne of God; the third and fourth way the elect, the children of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commanded]</hi> The difference betwixt the works of God and of man, God makes what he makes, only by his Word, but man what he doth, he doth, 1. With labour, <hi>non oreſed opere.</hi> 2. With inſtruments. 3. He muſt have time. 4. When he commands there muſt be ſomething that underſtands to obey, for if he commands ſtones they will not obey him, but God if he commands the ſea, or the windes, or ſtones, they obey; nay though there be neither perſon nor thing to obey him, as at the Creation, yet what he commands is done, <hi>Deo non minus obedit id quod non eſt, quàm id quod eſt.</hi> 2. And indeed this was the way to try whether he was God or no, for he that turns ſtones into bread by his command only, ſurely is God. 3. You may ſee how eaſily God can provide for his, for he can but command and it ſhall be done, ſood or raiment, or whatſoever he will he can do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That theſe ſtones]</hi> How can we deſpair of Gods providence, for he can <hi>quodlibet ex quolibet facere?</hi> 2. The obſervation I gave you even now, That when God commands they obey, but when we command we muſt not command ſenſleſſe things, for ſenſleſſe things will not obey us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be bread]</hi> The original ſo, not to be made, but to be bread, for he doth not command any man to do it, but onely commands what he will have to be, and when in any thing he uſeth the Miniſtery of Angels, it is to honour them or ſome other ſuch end, not for any need he hath of them. 2. Except
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119918:17"/>God could command things to be, and they upon that ſhould be, it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be, for ſince once there was no creature, whom ſhould he command to make the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that was created? for before the firſt there could be no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for then the firſt were not the firſt if there were one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bread]</hi> Why bread? Satan did uſe all his craft that he had to deceive our Saviour; for he tempts him here to a ſinne, which ſcarce ſeems to be a ſinne, for to uſe extraordinary means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what ordinary means will not attain, ſeems not to be evil; to work a miracle to relieve himſelf, and to ſatisfie one in the belief of ſuch a truth, as that he was the ſon of God, what ſin ſeems it to be? and then he doth not wiſh him to turn theſe ſins into delicates, but bread. To tempt very holy men to groſſe ſins would not be ſo proper, eſpecially at firſt.</p>

                     <hi>But he anſwered]</hi> The Queſtion may be, Why our Saviour did not turn thoſe ſtones into bread? whether becauſe the thing it ſelf was not fit to be done, or becauſe Satan propoſed it? I anſwer, becauſe the thing it ſelf was unlawfull, for if it had been becauſe Satan deſired him ſo to do, then he would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have yeelded to any of Satans deſires, but apparent it is that God himſelf yeelded to Satan in the trial of <hi>Job,</hi> in the deceiving of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and Chriſt in bidding them to go into the ſwine. 1. Our Saviours anſwer doth not import any ſuch thing, but he anſwers to the temptation, not the tempter; for his anſwer ſhews that the thing it ſelf ought not to be done whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had moved it, and ſo all his anſwers are. 2. Why did he anſwer Satan? 1. To ſhew that there cannot be ſo much ſaid for ſinne, but all may be anſwered, and more ſaid againſt it. 2. If by power he had overcome Satan, he had not left us an example, for we have not the power our Saviour had, we have the ſame Scripture. 3. If he had overcome him with power this time, he ſhould have hindred Satan from tempting him any more. 4. Some ſay there were two things that Satan deſired to ſinde out and accompliſh, 1. He deſired to make Chriſt ſinne. 2. He would fain know whether he were the ſon of God; now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119918:17"/>if our Saviour had by power overcome the devil, he had ſatisfied him in one of his intentions, for he had fully ſhewed himſelf to be the ſon of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is written]</hi> That is, in the word of God, for as we call the word of God the Bible and the Scripture, becauſe it is the chiefeſt of all books, and of all writings; ſo did the lews. 1. He doth not ſay where, that it was written in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> for that were needleſſe, for one book is not of more authority then another. 2. It was needleſſe in reſpect of Satan, for our Saviour well knew that Satan was ſo verſed in Scripture that he need not tell him where any thing was written. 3. To teach us that we alſo ſhould be ſo well verſed in Scripture that when any thing is quoted for Scripture, we ſhould not only be able to know whether it be Scripture or no, but to know the very place where it was written. Why did not our Saviour ſay what he pleaſed to ſay upon his own authority, ſince our very Saviours words are of equal authority with the holy Scripture? But by Scripture, 1. That he might not appear to be God. 2. That he might ſo overcome the devil, that we might follow him, which we could not if he had uſed his own authority. 3. That we might not relie on reaſon in things of ſalvation, for reaſon is not able to overcome temptations, for reaſon is not able to finde out all ſinne; ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> a learned man confeſſeth, that he had not known it to be a ſinne, except the Law had ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> Rom. 1. and if one cannot by reaſon finde out ſin, we cannot know what is a temptation, for how is it poſſible to know when one is perſwaded to ſin, if one doth not know what is ſinne? 4. That he might ſhew us the ſure way to vanquiſh all the fiery darts of Satan. <hi>Gildas</hi> the ancienteſt of all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Divines, cals the two Teſtaments the two ſhields of the Saints. 5. But where is it thus written? not in the ſelf ſame words any where, for the words are not ſo in the Hebrew, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> have them ſo, but why did not our Saviour uſe the words according to the Hebrew? I anſwer, that it doth not appear that our Saviour uſed theſe words, for this Goſpel being written firſt in Hebrew, and after tranſlated into Greek, divers things are added in the Greek which very probable were not in the Hebrew copy; as for example <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>You ſhall call his name Emanuel,</hi> which is ſaith the Text, <hi>God with us;</hi> and ſo here, becauſe the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlation is generally known more then the Hebrew; but you will again ſay, Since the <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint</hi> differs in divers things from the Hebrew, how can one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119918:18"/>bring any proof from it? I anſwer, that though places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are often quoted after that tranſlation, to prove; yet the paſſage of ſuch places where the difference of one lies, never is brought to prove any point, as in this place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man]</hi> He doth not ſay, the ſonne of God lives not, 1. For it is not ſo written, and he would confute Satan by Scripture, for the reaſons above mentioned. 2. Becauſe he would not make it known that he was the ſonne of God. 3. And chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would give him ſuch an anſwer, that might agree with us: if he had ſaid the ſonne of God, and not man, we could not have ſaid ſo. 2. Man, to ſhew the ſpecial providence of God towards man; for other creatures God doth by his perpetual ordinary providence feed and ſuſtain, but works not miracles; but for man he doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lives not by bread only]</hi> Three things are included, 1. That man doth live by bread, that is one thing by which he lives, or the inſtrumental cauſe of his bodily life and nouriſhment; for if bread were not any thing whereby he lived, it were not proper to ſay, he lived not only by bread. 2. That bread is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of life, though one have bread one may die. 3. Not abſolutely neceſſary, though one have it not we may live.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But by every word that proceeds]</hi> The meaning may be this, 1. That though a man have no bread, yet God can give other things to nouriſh, as he did Manna in the wilderneſſe, upon which indeed theſe words are ſpoken in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> 2. Or thus, that there are other things required for nouriſhment then bread, for if God had not by his word as well given the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack a power to digeſt and chylifie, and to the liver to ſanguifie, there could be no nouriſhment. The anſwer of our Saviour ſtands thus: 1. It is not neceſſary that I ſhould make theſe ſtones bread, ſince God can otherwiſe provide for me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I am in the wilderneſſe. 2. As your adviſe is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, one may not follow it, and yet do well, ſo it is not full if you take the ſecond ſenſe of the words, for though one hath bread, yet there is more required, for every word of God, the word whereby the ſtomack hath power to digeſt, is required: or thus, there are two lives of men, and two words of God, the life of nature and the life of grace; the word of God may be taken for that command of God, whereby he created all things; or it may be taken for the Scripture: if you take life and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119918:18"/>word the firſt way, I have explained it already. Bread alſo may be taken for natural bread, and ſacramental bread; if you take it the ſecond way, then thus, the life of grace is not only by eating the ſacramental bread, but alſo by obeying the reſt of the commands of God, this is the fitteſt place of Scripture that can be choſe; for when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the ſame place, the wilderneſſe, and in the ſame ſtraits, wanted bread, God ſent them Manna, and the end why he ſent them Manna was, that they might know that man lives not by bread alone, but by every word of God: as there it is ſet down, ſo that whenſoever they or any other, ſhould be in the ſtraits of wanting food in the wilderneſſe, that very work of giving Manna, and this very point ſhould come to their remembrance, and our Saviour doth remember it.</p>

                     <hi>Then]</hi> The devil flies to another temptation, he doth reply upon our Saviours anſwer: obſerve therefore, 1. The fulneſſe of our Saviours anſwer, the devil could not cavil at it, but was ſilenced for that temptation. 2. Obſerve the authority of the word of God, the devil cannot deny, either that it was ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or that ſuch writing is authentical, for if we were not bound by it, it were not a ſufficient argument to prove, that we ſhould or ſhould not do ſuch or ſuch a thing becauſe it is written ſo. 2. <hi>Then,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> related this temptation laſt, how is it that <hi>Matthew</hi> puts it in the ſecond place? The Queſtion is, Which of them was the firſt temptation? I anſwer, This that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi> relates firſt; the reaſons are, 1. Becauſe that hath a neerer relation, and more fitly follows the firſt, then that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> relates, in the ſecond place, and this in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, 1. Becauſe upon our Saviours quoting Scripture, moſt likely it is that he ſhould by Scripture go about to deceive him. 2. Becauſe the firſt temptation being to bring our Saviour to deſpair, or at leaſt to diffide of Gods mercy and providence, the next moſt probably ſhould be to make him preſume of his protection, for the remedies againſt one vice do almoſt encline one into the other, as he that keeps himſelf from being puſhed backward, he bends his force forward: In the primitive Church thoſe arguments which were brought to prove the Deity of Chriſt againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> were ſo ſtrong that they occaſioned <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119918:19"/>to deny his humanity. The devil therefore could never take ſo fit an opportunity to tempt Chriſt to preſume, as then when he found him ſo confident of Gods mercy. 2. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> uſeth words of order, for he ſaith <hi>then:</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> ſeems not to intend to obſerve the order, for in his relation he uſeth not <hi>then</hi> but <hi>again,</hi> but <hi>and</hi> he took him and he carried him. 3. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi> when he relates the laſt temptation, he ſaith, <hi>Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high,</hi> &amp;c. If the devil had not took him up before, he ſhould not have ſaid, he took him up again. 4. In the third temptation (according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi>) our Saviour bids ſatan, <hi>Avoid, Satan</hi> therefore did ſurely leave him for that time, elſe our Saviour ſhould have commanded the devil to do that which he did not: now our Saviour never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the evil ſpirits that which he did not make them do, when he bid them come out they came out, and when he bid them avoid they avoided: Satan therefore after our Saviour bid him avoid, left him for that time, it was therefore the laſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But you may ſay, Doth not <hi>Luke</hi> miſtake, and can it be true what he writes, and yet true what <hi>Matthew</hi> writes? for the ſame temptation cannot poſſibly be the ſecond and the third, except our Saviour was twice tempted with the ſame temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I anſwer, that he that ſaith, that God created man and beaſts, and the light and the ſunne, ſaith as true, as he that ſaith, that God created the ſunne and light, and beaſts and man, though he doth not relate Gods works in the ſame order as they were made; ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke,</hi> when he ſaith that, <hi>And the devil took him into an high mountain,</hi> and alſo <hi>took him and ſet him upon a pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Temple,</hi> ſaith as true, as if he had related them in the ſame order that they were done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The devil took him]</hi> Some may wonder why our Saviour would ſuffer himſelf to be taken and carried up and down at the devils pleaſure: But I anſwer, it is no marvel, for he ſuffered himſelf to be uſed farre worſe at his death, and daily in his members. 2. By his ſuffering ſatan to take his courſe, and to reſtrain him in nothing, he did more fully overcome him, for if he had been reſtrained, it might have haply be ſaid, if he had not been reſtrained, he had prevailed againſt our Saviour. 2. He did not himſelf go, but was carried, to teach us, that we muſt not be active, but only paſſive in our temptations. 3. See how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant the devil is, and how indefatigable in the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It is a caution to us not to content our ſelves, and leave off our watch, though we have overcome one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>

                     <hi>Luke,</hi> called it holy, 1. To diſtinguiſh it from all other Cities of the Gentiles who worſhipped Idols. 2. Becauſe in that City only the main duties of religion were to be performed; now before we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us ſee the ſubtilty of this temptation; 1. As I have ſhewed the former temptation being to diffidence, the way to defend him from that, muſt needs be ſomething that might make him to confide in God, and whoſoever is free from one extream, if he be vicious or faulty is guilty of the other extream, therefore the likelieſt way to prevail is to try him in a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of preſumption, that is free from deſpair. 2. The ſecond point of ſubtilty is, that he fights with him with his own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and tempts him with a place of Scripture. 3. That he did tempt him with ſo many temptations in one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſet him upon the pinacle of the Temple]</hi> Why ſhould he ſet him there? 1. To tempt him to fear of falling. 2. To have a fit place for his temptation, for the place muſt be high, or it was not fit for the temptation; theſe are the reaſons why he carried him to ſo high a place: But why to that place, for if he had carried him to ſome cliffe of ſome high rock, it might be as well fit for that? 3. Therefore it was to tempt him to vain-glory, for all the people looking on him, as they could not chuſe but wonder, to ſee one ſtanding on the pinacle of the Temple, and it would be a great deal of honour for him before all the people to do ſuch a miracle, and to get himſelf honour before all the people. 2. To make the temptation take, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as if he ſhould ſay, When I was alone with you in the wilderneſſe, then it was not to ſo much purpoſe to prove thy ſelf by ſome rare work the ſonne of God; but now here are holy men that come to the Temple, it is a very neceſſary point for them to believe, therefore now ſhew thy ſelf who thou art, fear not, for it is written, and therefore he was ſet on the pinacle the moſt conſpicuous place. 2. It was not onely conſpicuous that they might ſee him, but ſuch a place that every one would ſtand gazing upon him; for not onely they would wonder how he could come down, but how he got up thither, there being no ſcaffolds, nor ladder, nor, <hi>&amp;c. Joſephus</hi> writes that theſe pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were upon the Temple ſet with ſharp pikes of iron, that birds might not ſet upon them to defile the Temple.</p>

Becauſe he was not reſolved of his doubt, nor yet ſatisfied whether our Saviour was the ſonne of God or no, and if you obſerve in our Saviours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to others, when out of malice intending to entrap him, or out of curioſity, any one went about to have him manifeſt that which was not fit in thoſe reſpects to be known; he though they never ſo cunningly enquired of him, alwayes anſwered ſo, that they could not be by his anſwer reſolved. So you may ſee the ſubtilty of this temptation appears, that none, eſpecially this temptation, was not ſingle: For, 1. Of fear and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for it would make one afraid of falling to be ſet ſo high, and have ſo little hold. 2. Of pride, to ſhew himſelf and his power needleſly to the people. 3. Of preſumption, in caſting himſelf upon the immediate providence of God, when he need not. 2. Becauſe theſe words are very fit for his other purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to perſwade him to preſumption, as in the other not to ſtay while God have provided for him, for he had power in his own hands. 3. Becauſe Satan knows how prone every one is, to ſeem rathes more then leſſe then he is; but our bleſſed Saviour never deſired to glorifie himſelf, but in ſtead of being puffed up, ſeeming to have what he had not, he emptied himſelf of what he had. 4. The whole 91. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeems to be meant of the ſon of God, and therefore it was convenient to ſay, <hi>If,</hi> &amp;c. that the place of Scripture might more fitly ſo agree with the the occaſion, and to be meant eſpecially, if not onely of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down]</hi> It doth not follow either, if one be the ſonne of God, that one ought to caſt ones ſelf down; nor if one caſt ones ſelf down, that one is the ſonne of God. 2. Why did not ſatan caſt him down, but wiſh him to caſt himſelf down? 1. It might be becauſe that Satan had not ſo much power over our Saviour, he had power to tempt, he had not power to throw down. 2. Becauſe if he could have attained one end of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119918:20"/>temptation, <hi>viz.</hi> to know whether he was the ſon of God, yet he could not that way have attained the other main end, which was to cauſe him to ſinne, for it had been no ſinne to be caſt down, a ſinne it is to caſt ones ſelf, for the other doth not tempt God. 3. Or might it not be leſt our Saviour ſhould think that he intended any hurt unto him? for Satan all this while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf, and would not be known who he was, nor did our Saviour but in the laſt temptation take any notice who he was. 4. Or, was it not becauſe he would not do any thing ſo that might occaſion our Saviours confidence in God, or if you will, occaſion the preſence of the holy Angels, for fear they ſhould aſſiſt our Saviour, or diſcover him, or becauſe he loved not their company? for all theſe he knew would have come to paſſe, if he had caſt our Saviour down; for ſuppoſing our Saviour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a very holy man, he knew that the Angels in ſuch a caſe would bear him in their hands. 2. The advice of Satan ſtands thus, It is not for thee to ſtand here alwayes, and it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible almoſt, for the very winde will blow thee off, and beſides thou wilt be ſtarved, and to get down is dangerous, for how could one get down from ſuch a place and not fall? therefore it will come to this that thou wilt fall, therefore better to caſt thy ſelf down, for by doing ſo, thou ſhalt prove thy ſelf the ſonne of God to all this people. If in thy ſtriving to get down ſafely thou ſhouldſt chance to fall, then indeed the Angels would keep thee from any hurt, Gods providence over thee might appear, but thy conſidence in him would not ſo appear, nay thy diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would haply too much appear, for the people ſeeing thee on the pinacle of the Temple, ſuppoſe that thou cameſt up for ſome ſuch end, to do ſomething of note, not that thou wenteſt up only to come down again. 3. Caſt thy ſelf down headlong, not leap down, that the miracle may be more apparent. 4. Great comfort and inſtruction may be raiſed from this; Satan tempts thee to make away thy ſelf, thou mayeſt be the childe of God for all this, for our Saviour was tempted to caſt himſelf down.</p>

                     <hi>For it is written]</hi> 1. The devil uſeth not any place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in the other temptations; in the former he did not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour had not diſcovered his great eſteem of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, now he had: in the latter he did not, for he could not finde any place fit to perſwade to idolatry. 2. The reaſon why he uſeth it here, is becauſe he would ſee if he could beat our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour at his own weapon, and becauſe he knew that he would
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119918:21"/>be more moved with a text of Scripture, for ſince man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, here is the word that proceeded from God, <hi>It is written,</hi> it is the word of God, therefore you need not to fear death, though you caſt your ſelf down. 3. Haply he might think eaſily to deceive our Saviour, for he knew that our Saviour was never brought up in learning, he was neither like <hi>Moſes</hi> brought up in all the learning of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> for he came thence very young; nor as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but with his father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Luke 2. ult. 4. He brought this not only as if our Saviour might, but ought ſo to do, as if this had been a prophecy of our Saviour, and he ought to fulfill it. 5. You may ſee how expert the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is in the Scripture, for in the whole Bible he could not have choſe a fitter place for the temptation. 6. That we muſt not think the cauſe good, becauſe they that were the greateſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks do bring Scripture, but like Satan, where they bring Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture once, they bring and ſtand upon reaſon twice as much, but you art to try whether they rightly alledge it.</p>

                     <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge]</hi> You ſee the wonderfull love of God to thoſe that are his, 1. He makes Angels our ſervants to look to us and keep us, and to wait on us, we ſhould rather be ſervants to them; Kings and Queens are nurſing fathers and nurſing mothers. 2. He hath given <hi>his</hi> Angels, thoſe about his own throne; all Angels are his, good and bad, by creation, but the good, Angels are now only called his Angels, the other are called the devils angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. 3. Angels, which if you compare with that which follows there, you may ſee that every good man hath many Angels, not only every man his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Angel. 4. A <hi>charge,</hi> a ſpecial command. 5. To <hi>keep</hi> thee, not only as <hi>David</hi> gave a charge concerning <hi>Abſolom, Do the young man no harm</hi> 6. And <hi>they ſhal bear thee up in their hands,</hi> they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look to us leſt we fall, but to carry us leſt we fall. 7. <hi>Leſt at any time,</hi> not a moment that their vigilance ceaſeth. 8. They keep us, that not only not often, but not once. 9. Why all this care? all leſt we ſhould hurt our foot, not thy feet, <hi>the foot,</hi> the loweſt and the meaneſt part, <hi>pars inſima, pars unica,</hi> that he ſaith thy foot, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it follows, he takes care of all the reſt of the body, he that takes care of the leſſer things will take care for the greater. 1. It is only to keep one from hurting; the next thing to be conſidered is the ſubtilty and falſhood of the devil in citing this place, 1. They appear in citing ſo fit a place, for it is as if it had been a Prophecy on purpoſe for that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119918:21"/>very occaſion, for it ſpeaks of bearing up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone. 2. He leaves out that which would make againſt him. 3. He quotes it as if it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly meant of our Saviour, whereas it is meant of all holy men; for our Saviour wanted not the protection of Angels, but they his: ſee how fitly this follows upon the former, as if he ſhould ſay, Thou wilt not turn ſtones into bread, but thou wilt caſt thy ſelf upon the providence of God, do ſo now, what needeſt thou trouble thy ſelf to come down, caſt thy ſelf upon the providence of God, caſt thy ſelf down? and ſince the word of God is that thou ſo much relieſt upon; here is the word of God, it is written.</p>

                     <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, It is written again]</hi> Here was no pauſing, it put not our Saviour to a ſtand. 1. You may ſee the great wiſdom of Chriſt, which appears firſt that he anſwered Satan; for doubtleſſe this was the ſubtileſt temptation that the devil could invent, yet our Saviour anſwered him. There is a ſtory of a Limner, that to ſhew his Art drew a white line ſo ſmall, that it could hardly be diſcerned; another to ſhew that he could excell him drew a black line thorow the middle of it, it required an accurate ſight to diſcern either; but our Saviour at firſt view immediately diſcerned this black line of temptation to run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the plauſible advice that Satan gave our Saviour. 2. The next thing that ſhews our Saviours wiſdome, was in giving ſo ſpeedy an anſwer: When we are a diſputing many times, we are forced to give ſuch an anſwer, which may face the objection whilſt we have time to rally our forces that we may be able to give ſuch a full anſwer as may wholly rout it: but our Saviour at firſt gives ſuch an anſwer as gets a plenary victory over the temptation, and that is the laſt act of Chriſts wiſdome that he gives ſuch an anſwer, which conſidering all things a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and full anſwer could not be given by the wiſdom of men or Angels, nor of Chriſt himſelf, though they had never ſo long time to conſider of it; for it may not be ſaid of Chriſt that his ſecond thoughts or actions could be more wiſe. 2. The holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt doth exceedingly appear in giving ſo ſpeedy a denial: for as it would have argued ſome defect in his wiſdome not to have been able at firſt view to diſcover it to be a ſin, which Satan perſwaded him to, ſo having diſcovered it to be a ſin, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119918:22"/>would have been a ſinne in Chriſt to have conſulted whether he ſhould have done it or no, for it argues coldneſſe of love to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether we ſhould offend God or no, and it argues a great deal of folly; for there is no proportionable weight between any motive that can be brought to perſwade us to ſinne, if it be compared with the evil of the leaſt ſin to which it perſwades us. So that to ſtand weighing (that is conſulting,) which of thoſe two have greateſt weight in them, argues as great folly, as if one ſhould ſtand weighing whether a feather or a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of lead were heavier. 3. 'Tis againſt the nature of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, for <hi>Deus &amp; peccatum non cadunt ſubconſultatione,</hi> God and ſinne cannot be conſulted of, we may conſult how we may ſerve God, but not whether we ſhould ſerve God. He without any ſtay anſwered and ſaid, our Saviour ſtill anſwers by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to ſhew us that the Word is not profitable to anſwer one, but all kindes of temptation. 2. To ſhew that the abuſe of a thing ſhould not take away the uſe of it. 3. Again, not to argue any contradiction in the Scripture, but to ſhew us the beſt way to underſtand Scripture is by comparing one place with another. 2. To ſhew us how excellent it is to balance and counterpoiſe Scripture, to put thoſe places that command a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſet down promiſes, ſhould be taken and joyned with thoſe that ſets the limit to the duty, and the conditions to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: But the Queſtion may be, Why did not our Saviour, ſince the devil alledged the place falſly, ſhew the errour and take that way to anſwer, ſince it is very dangerous to let the Scripture be miſunderſtood, and we ſhould not let any go on in an errour? The reaſons might be, 1. If he had took that way, haply Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan might have brought another place to that purpoſe, to which the anſwer to this place would not ſerve; therefore our Saviour brings rather a place of Scripture to confute him: now this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer would ſerve not only for this place, but for all other places of this kinde whatſoever. 2. Becauſe this did in effect anſwer and ſhew the very words that the devil left out; for to tempt God is to expect Gods protection out of his wayes. 3. That he might ſhew us that Scripture is ſufficient to reſiſt and avoid all temptations of all kinds. 4. As hath been ſaid before, that we might have a rule to expound Scripture. 5. To ſhew us that faith, that is, the object of faith, the word of God is the only way (not reaſon) to quench the fiery darts of Satan. 6. The reforming of the erroneous underſtanding of Scripture, need not be done to Satan, 1. Becauſe Satan is incorrigible,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119918:22"/>and ſo it would do him no good. 2. He did not cite the place wrong out of ignorance, but out of ſubtilty and craft.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. The meaning is not as if he ſhould ſay, Why doſt thou tempt me, I am the Lord thy God, and it is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, therefore thou ſhalt not tempt me? 1. For then he ſhould have forbidden the devil to tempt him any more. 2. The Scripture is written for <hi>our</hi> not for Satans inſtruction. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had not been ſo fit for us, for if that be meant of the devil, it belongs not to us principally. 4. Becauſe evidently the command in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is given to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and not to Satan. 2. In the text in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> it is; <hi>you</hi> ſhall not tempt the Lord; here, <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, Why this change? 1. Was it not to ſhew us, that we ought to apply commands, and prohibitions to our ſelves, thoſe that are ſpoken to all, and ſo alſo promiſes, if we are in the ſame caſe. 2. Was it not becauſe that here it is written ſo in the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> and not in the Hebrew, not <hi>verbatim</hi> according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, becauſe the <hi>Septuagint</hi> being in Greek, was farre more generally had and underſtood. 3. It is to be conſidered, what it is to tempt God; by what it is to tempt man, we may finde out what it is to tempt God; to tempt a man is to deſire, or ſome way to endeavour to encline him to break that Law that ought to rule him, and that is impoſed upon him: now you muſt underſtand that God hath propoſed a Law to himſelf to follow in the ruling of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> to work and bring to paſſe all things by means, not immediately, as to preſerve mans life by nouriſhing him, &amp; nouriſhing him by food, not immediately; and this Law God doth obſerve, except ſome neceſſity requires his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate providence and power; whoſoever would have God break this Law, and have him work wonders and miracles to bring to paſſe that which by means which he hath afforded us may be done, is ſaid to tempt God, as apparently in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pration it is. 2. Tempting is the ſame with trying, to make a needleſſe experiment; now all experiments concerning God are needleſſe, for needleſſe are thoſe means without which the end may as well be attained, or with which the end cannot be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. Therefore, thoſe tempt God, who caſt themſelves upon the immediate providence of God; now he doth not caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who neceſſarily ventures, and puts himſelf upon Gods immediate providence by obſerving Gods Laws, as the three
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119918:23"/>children, but God brings them into it, and God will deliver them: ſo alſo if by any other one be brought to ſuch ſtraits, that without Gods immediate providence one cannot eſcape, ſo were they. 2. Thoſe that tie God to ſuch and ſuch means, or preſcribe the manner or time how, and when God ſhall deliver them. 3. There are two kindes or wayes of tempting God, one when the end of our words or actions is to finde out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be powerfull, wiſe, good, this is called an expreſſe temptation. The ſecond kinde is, when one doth or ſpeaks any thing, which although we do it not with that intent, yet there can be no other end why one ſhould do it, then by that to be certified of ſome thing concerning Gods Attributes; for if one would make an experiment one would uſe that very way, and this is called an interpretative temptation; now to tempt God that is alwayes a ſinne, for it alwayes ſuppoſeth infidelity and ignorance of ſome inherent excellency in God, or from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of his goodneſſe to us, or out of idleneſſe that we will not trouble our ſelves to finde out, or uſe the means, which God hath afforded us: But <hi>James</hi> 1.13. <hi>God is not tempted with evil,</hi> if God cannot be tempted, what need we be forbid to tempt him? I anſwer, 1. There are two kindes of temptation, proving and ſeducing; wicked men do tempt God the firſt way, and that is the thing we are forbid; but the ſecond, to go about to perſwade God to any ſinne, none doth tempt him ſo, and of that kinde of temptation doth the Apoſtle ſpeak, for the other words ſhew what kinde of temptation is meant; <hi>God tempts no man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, not to ſeduce him, but to prove him he doth, therefore the other words are to be meant of the ſame kinde of temptation. 2. God is not tempted with evil, may be meant thus; God is not allured, no evil doth any way encline him, but he is utterly averſe from all evil: If one ſhould ſee ſome curious ripe fruit, and one were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all fruit, one is uſed to ſay to ſee ſuch curious fruit would tempt one ſhrewdly, and when one anſwers no, it would not tempt me; ones meaning is, it would not encline me or make me deſire to eat it: ſo no evil doth encline God to like it. It is ſaid, <hi>The Lord thy God,</hi> to give us a reaſon why we ſhould not tempt him; for ſince our tempting God comes from our doubting, and the things we uſually doubt of are his power or his goodneſſe to us; here is a word for each, <hi>The Lord,</hi> there his power; <hi>Thy God,</hi> there his goodneſſe: But why is it ſaid, the Lord, and thy God, and not thy Lord? The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119918:23"/>we uſe to doubt of Gods power, without any relation to our ſelves, but when we doubt of his goodneſſe it is in relation to our ſelves.</p>

                     <hi>Luke</hi> relates it before this. 2. The reaſon why our Saviour would again be tempted, was, becauſe he had not yet left us an example of the moſt commoneſt of all temptations, <hi>viz.</hi> ambition and covetouſneſſe. 3. To ſhew the indefatigableneſſe of the devil, as long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains any way untried he ceaſeth not. 4. The Queſtion may be, Whence Satan took our Saviour? and moſt probable it is, that it was from the pinacle of the Temple, for it is not likely that he came down thence; and that may be one reaſon, why it is ſaid an exceeding high mountain; for the pinacle of the Temple was higher then ordinary mountains. For <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> it ſelf was built upon an hill; for the devil after he had ſet our Saviour upon the pinacle he left him a while to ſee what would be the iſſue of it, to which it may be thoſe words of <hi>Luke</hi> do relate, <hi>viz. And he left him for a ſeaſon;</hi> for, it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtrengthen the temptation, that he ſhould withdraw himſelf. 2. Becauſe we do not reade of, nor is it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the devil did ever tempt our Saviour any more after this manner vocally, becauſe he knew him to be the ſonne of God; and our Saviour immediately after this began to preach and caſt out devils: but I ſubmit, and am willing that any man ſhould think otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An exceeding high mountain]</hi> It is haply not poſſible for any man to tell out of Scripture, or any other way, what mountain this was, whether it was the mountain from which <hi>Moſes</hi> beheld the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or any other, is a curioſity to enquire. 2. The reaſon why he carried him to ſo high a mountain, was, that he might have the fuller and larger proſpect.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119918:24"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhewed to him all the kingdoms of the world]</hi> How could that be, for though the mountain had been as high as the Sunne, or a thouſand thouſand times higher, impoſſible it is for a man to ſee half the world from thence, for the Sunne that is ſo high and farre bigger then the earth ſees but a little more then half at the ſame time? Nay ones eye cannot ſee to diſcern Cities, or any ſuch thing not many miles; for upon the ſea with the help of glaſſes, they cannot ſee very far, <hi>Galataeus</hi> his glaſſe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt now in the world, ſhews not above fourſcore miles any whit diſtinctly. 2. He did not with his finger pointing ſay, There is <hi>Rome,</hi> and there lies <hi>Grecce,</hi> &amp;c. and then tell him the commodities, wealth and glory of thoſe Countreys, 1. Becauſe he might as well have done that on the pinacle, and never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him thence. 2. Becauſe he ſhewed them as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> relates in a moment, and a diſcourſe of the glory of ſuch kingdoms, would be long: likely it ſeems, that by ſome apparitions and ſights in the air, he might ſhew thoſe things he deſired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our Saviour; and the reaſon why he took him to an high mountain to ſhew him this ſight, was that by the real being upon the mountain, the reſt might not ſeem preſtigious, for if he had ſhewed theſe things while he was on the pinacle, he might ſurely know that whatſoever he ſaw beſides the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple, were meer figments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the glory of them]</hi> He omits not any thing that might make for his purpoſe: <hi>All the kingdoms,</hi> he therein ſhewed the largeneſſe of the dominions he offered, <hi>And in the glory,</hi> the magnificence of them. 2. He ſhewed the glory of them, but not the cares, the manifold dangers of them: Satan alwaye, ſets the beſt ſide outward, and conceals that which might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>All this was done in a moment;</hi> 1. To ſhew that the glory is momentany. 2.

                     <hi>If thou falling down wilt worſhip me]</hi> 1. The things the devil offers are poor and temporal, the things God offers are glorious and eternal. 2.

There are two kindes of Gods attributes, his communicable and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, and the endeavours and deſires of the good and bad are differenced by them: for Satan, and his Angels, and his followers ſtrive to be like him in his incommunicable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as worſhip, honour and glory, and to be loved and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all; but the righteous they ſtrive for holineſſe, mercy and love, and patience, and reſtore the image of God which is ſo much defaced: and the image of God which man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, did certainly conſiſt in the participation of thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which are communicable, for God created him in his image, good and bad ſtrive to be like God, <hi>Ero ficut altiſſimus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lucifer, And be you mercifull as your heavenly Father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour; but the one he will be like God in power and glory, <hi>ſicut altiſſimus,</hi> the other in holineſſe and power, <hi>Ero ſicut ſanctiſſimus:</hi> This temptation differs from the former, 1. He quotes no Scripture for this, the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for this ſinne and groſſe errour of idolatry there is not any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119918:25"/>thing in holy Scripture to countenance, but not any ſinne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever more ſpoke againſt then idolatry. 2. In the other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations he promiſed nothing, before this he prefixes a promiſe, and a large offer. 3. In the other he ſaith, <hi>If thou art the ſonne of God,</hi> not ſo here, the reaſon may be, that that clauſe was againſt him here, for if he was the ſon of God, the offer of giving him all theſe things were vain, for they were his before. 2. To wiſh him to worſhip him were madneſs; for the ſon of God ought to worſhip none, much leſſe, whom none ſhould worſhip, Satan.</p>

                     <hi>Then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Avoid Satan]</hi> Our Saviour bids him not avoid before, 1. Becauſe he had not ſuffered, and by conſequence not left us an example, and a rule how to anſwer all kinds of temptations. 2. To teach, 1. That we are pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to bear injuries offered to our ſelves, but for injuries and blaſphemies againſt God, not ſo much as to hear them with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. 2. To teach us what company to avoid. 1. Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, for here Satan makes himſelf God, in ſaying, all things were his. 2. Thoſe that tempt us to idolatry, we are to avoid their company; nay indeed in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> whoſoever tempted one to idolatry, though it were ones childe, one wife, or ones friend, one were to reveal him, and have him ſtoned. 2. Our Saviour took no notice that he was Satan before, but now he doth, &amp; now he plainly ſhewed himſelf, for whoſoever ſaith, that all things are his to beſtow, and will be worſhipped, is either God or the devil. Satan is an Hebrew word and ſignifies adverſary.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God]</hi> Why doth not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our anſwer him ſome other way, he might have anſwered him, that all thoſe things were not his to give, but our Saviour doth not give ſuch an anſwer, as might only ſatisfie that temptation, but all temptations whatſoever there were or might be to that ſince; for if our Saviour had been onely to defend and anſwer for himſelf, he might and haply would have anſwered otherwiſe, but he being in our ſtead, and to leave us an example, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119918:25"/>ſo as it might be beſt for us, and that we might have a patern and anſwer left for us to anſwer all temptations of that kinde; for ſuppoſe he had ſaid to Satan, the things that thou offereſt are not in thy power to give, two inconveniences would have followed, 1. That anſwer would not have ſerved us, when man, ſuppoſe the King or ſome great man had offered ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment as was in his power to give; our Saviours anſwer would not have ſerved us, and ſo one, if not the only end of his temptation had failed, <hi>viz.</hi> to leave us a way to overcome all kinde of temptations. 2. It might have ſeemed that he would have fallen down, if he had had power to give what he promiſed. May it not be to ſhow us that we are firſt to conſider to what we are perſwaded to before we conſider the motives by which we are perſwaded; and if it appears to be a ſin, that we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the motives, for that will prove a ſnare unto us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt diſcovering this to be abominable idolatry, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers not to the motives but to the temptations.</p>

Why did our Saviour ſtay while he heard the news, for he knew not only the very inſtant, when it was done, but long before when it ſhould be done, and need not ſtay while the news was brought him? 1. He ſtayed while the news was brought, becauſe he knew that before that the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees knew that work was accompliſhed, they would not go about to do any thing againſt him, and ſo long while the news came of <hi>Johns</hi> impriſonment, he was ſafe. 2.

Here it is ſaid, that <hi>When John was delivered up;</hi> for our Tranſlation, when he was caſt into priſon, ſtands not with the original. 2. <hi>John</hi> was out of the juriſdiction of <hi>Herod,</hi> as appears <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1. for the wilderneſſe of <hi>Judea</hi> was not within the precincts of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilce,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> was only Tetrarch of <hi>Galilce</hi> at that time. 3.

And if you ſhall ſay, Why ſhould our Saviour flee into <hi>Galilee,</hi> where <hi>Herod</hi> ruled, for he might expect the ſame uſage? I anſwer no, for the reaſon why <hi>Herod</hi> perſecuted <hi>John,</hi> our Saviour never did, <hi>viz.</hi> reprove <hi>Herod</hi> for his inceſtuous marriage; but the reaſon which made the Jews ſo incenſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the reproving of their hypocriſie, and not ſtanding for the Ceremonies, our Saviour was no leſſe exact then <hi>John.</hi>

I anſwer, that divers things that God foretels, he doth not foretell to that end, that he might prove himſelf omniſcient, and to know things before they come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119918:27"/>to paſſe, for if ſo, then things ſhould not come to paſſe, becauſe they are fore-told, but be fore-told, becauſe they are to come to paſſe, but God fore-tels them, becauſe he intends to do them, and rather to prove his omnipotence then his omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or his goodneſſe, ſo that Chriſt might dwell in <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> to perform that promiſe which God had made in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets time; for although the performing of that Prophecy was not the only cauſe of Chriſts dwelling in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> yet had there been no other cauſe, that had been a ſufficient cauſe; this is certain, that God firſt intends to do good to a man or people before he promiſes ſo to do, and promiſeth ſo to do, if at all he promiſeth before he doth it: Gods intention to do good, conſidering his immutability, is the primary cauſe of the doing that good which he intended, but his intention layes no obligation, whereby any man may challenge of him ſo to do, but his promiſe doth lay an obligation, and therefore it is very good ſenſe to ſay, he did ſo that it might be fulfilled which was promiſed. If it had been ſaid, that ſo it was fulfilled which was propheſied, it had only ſhewed Gods omniſcience of things to come, but by being ſaid, that it might be fulfilled, it ſhews his power, being able to bring to paſſe what he promiſed, and alſo his ſidelity and truth, in bringing to paſſe what he had promiſed. Again, if it had been ſaid, that ſo it was fulfilled, it not importing any act of Gods providence in bringing of it ſo to paſſe, but only of his preſcience in knowing that it ſhould ſo come to paſſe, it did no way oblige, or at leaſt not ſo much, thoſe that received that bleſſing to thankfulneſſe, it might make them admire him for his omniſcience, but not bleſſe him for his goodneſſe; for there is little or no thanks due to him, that tels me what good ſhall hereafter befall me, but there are many thanks to him that fore-tels and promiſes that ſuch a good thing he will do for me. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 1. That all that God promiſes he brings to paſſe though it belong after, wherefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one truſting in his promiſes ſhould be deceived. 2.

Becauſe it was the moſt convenienteſt doctrine for him to preach at firſt, and there was no reaſon why he ſhould avoid it, becauſe <hi>John</hi> preached it before him; and therefore when he ſends his own Diſciples to preach, he bids them begin the publiſhing of the Goſpel, with the ſelf ſame words, which appears by comparing thoſe two places together, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.7. 2.

By conſequence it is not an outward change, but argues ſome repentance, one may have reſtraining grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. 3. It argues that all are gone aſtray, or elſe there need be no returning. 4. It ſhews that the Goſpel is the right way to bring one to repentance, <hi>And the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</hi> is brought as the reaſon and motive of repentance, the hammer of the Law may break us in pieces, but 'tis the fire of the Goſpel that purges us from our droſſe. 4. The Goſpel is a kingdome to rule us, as well as promiſes a kingdome to be beſtowed upon us. Divers look upon the Goſpel as promiſing a Kingdome of Glory, but not as it ſets in us a Kingdom of grace, but except the Kingdom of God firſt come into us, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into it. 5.

                     <hi>Caſting a net into theſea, for they were fiſhers]</hi> 1. We do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reade in Scripture that thoſe men to whom God ſhewed any great revelation, or beſtowed any great bleſſing, he did it in the time when they were well imployed in the works of their callings, ſo to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo to the ſhepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. and ſo to theſe four Diſciples in this Chapter. 2. Since it is apparent by <hi>John</hi> 1. that theſe were called to the faith before, it ſhews that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ones general calling doth not hinder induſtry in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling. 3. It is not to be underſtood that our Saviour Chriſt called them juſt at that time when they were caſting their nets into the ſea; for it is probable, that this their caſting their nets into the ſea, was part of that unfruitfull labour which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to our Saviour of, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5. after which our Saviour preached to the people out of their ſhip, and the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous draught of fiſhes, was before the following words were ſpoken, <hi>They were fiſhers:</hi> 1. To ſhew us, that every one ſhould follow their own calling, and not to intermeddle with other mens. 2. Or to ſhew us that this their fiſhing was not their recreation, but their calling; the reaſon why he choſe ignorant men to be his Diſciples, was to avoid calumny, for if they had been learned men, it might be objected, that they by ſophiſtry or eloquence did convert men to be of their opinion. 2. He choſe the poor, leſt if he had choſe the potent, Chriſtian religion might be thought to be introduced into the world by power and by force. 3. He choſe the ſimple, leſt it might have been thought that Chriſtian religion had been brought into the world by craft and ſubtilty. 2. That Chriſts power and excellency might more appear, for the weaker the inſtrument is the greater is his glory that brings great things to paſſe by it: or elſe the reaſon why he choſe poor men, might be in reſpect of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples themſelves, for if he had choſen thoſe who were eloquent, or learned, or politick men, they might have thought that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119918:30"/>Chriſt had choſe them, becauſe they were ſo, but he, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>choſe the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things,</hi> &amp;c. v. 27, 28. and then he ſets down the reaſon, <hi>viz. That no fleſh might glory in his preſence;</hi> for if the wiſe ſhould convert the ſimple, and the ſtrong the weak, they might think that by their own arm, and by their own wiſdom they had brought ſuch mighty things to paſſe. Again, in reſpect of thoſe that were to be converted by the Diſciples, for the weaker the inſtruments is, the more they that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted acknowledge that they owe to God for their converſion; for God would have no one attribute his converſion to man, as to the cauſe of it, and this is the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſets down why the veſſel that conveighs the treaſure to us is earthen, becauſe the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. yet notwithſtanding afterwards rich, learned and wiſe men were converted by our Saviour, but not to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles but to be Chriſtians only, leſt any one ſhould think (if all had been ſimple that had been converted by our Saviour) that our Saviour wrought upon the ſimplicity and ignorance of the people, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a learned man, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> an honourable Councellour, <hi>Zacheus</hi> a rich man.</p>

Here is the effectualneſſe of Chriſts calling, that without any delay or doubt of the performance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that Chriſt made unto them, they obeyed his command. 3. The Queſtion is, Why it is here ſaid they left their nets, whereas it is ſpoken before but of one net, that they caſt into the ſea? The order of the Hiſtory goes thus, Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great draught of fiſhes, and <hi>Peters</hi> falling down at our Saviours feet, our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter, Fear not,</hi> afterward thou ſhalt catch men; and after they had brought their own and their partners nets, which helped them to the ſhore, then our Saviour ſaid theſe words, <hi>Follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men.</hi> 4.

                     <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>They left all,</hi> to wit, their nets, their ſhip, and their great draught of fiſhes. 5. It is not ſaid, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of their nets, but that they left them, to ſhew that they cared not what became of all things ſo they might gain Chriſt; for as when the Sunne ſhines all the ſtars add nothing to the light, ſo Chriſt and all things are no more then Chriſt alone, and they knew that Chriſt that could work ſuch a miracle, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their money to provide for them. 6.

                     <hi>The poor]</hi> It is very ſeriouſly to be obſerved and conſidered by all rich men, how often the Scripture makes mention of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral promiſes to poor men, and never ſo to rich men, for you ſhall never reade Bleſſed are the rich, but <hi>woe to you that are rich,</hi> and many cautions given us concerning riches; ſurely there is ſomething and very much in it, yet poverty is not in it ſelf a bleſſing, nor riches a curſe, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Agur</hi> deprecates po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty as well as riches, but neither as in themſelves bad or curſes, but as temptations to ſinne, and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 6. it is not Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is poverty, nor woe to riches, but <hi>Bleſsed are the poor,</hi> and <hi>wo to you rich men,</hi> for the good or bad is not in the things, but in the perſons: Rich men are worſe then riches, and poor men better then poverty; and when it is ſaid by <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Bleſsed are the poor,</hi> it is meant that generally more poor men are bleſſed then rich men, for the <hi>poor receive the Goſpel;</hi> more poor are converted then rich, for ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not many noble, nor mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27. for theſe temporal bleſſings do ſteal away our hearts from God, and make us look no farther for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thoſe rich men that have been good, have generally been good before they were rich, not rich before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Spirit]</hi> 1. Thoſe may be called poor in ſpirit who do not deſire nor love riches, and ſo he that is rich may be poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if his heart be not ſet on riches, and he that is poor in eſtate may not be poor in ſpirit, if he is not content with his poverty.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119918:33"/>2. Poor in ſpirit may be interpreted, Bleſſed are the humble, poor-ſpirited men, not your high ſpirits, thoſe that think poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and meanly of themſelves, where the chief grace of a Chriſtian is humility, which is a foundation, the more profound it is, the ſtronger and firmer are all the graces that are built on it. 3. It is not to be underſtood that thoſe are bleſſed that are poor ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, who have a poor and ſmall meaſure of the ſpirit; nay thoſe who are moſt empty of themſelves are fulleſt of God, and of his ſpirit. 4. The bleſſing is not to the outward humility or poverty, but to the inward, for though inward humility ſtand with outward pride, yet outward humility may ſtand with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pride. 5. Or he may be thought to be meant, who by choice and voluntarily carries himſelf, as one who is a poor-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited man doth, by nature, onely he who is a poor ſpirited man, is ſo in all things, but this man of whom Chriſt ſpeaks is ſo in all things but the things that belong to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For theirs is the Kingdome of God.]</hi> 1. This being brought as a reaſon to prove them bleſſed, it infallibly argues, that thoſe who are the heirs of the Kingdom of God, how great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſoever the world layes on them, or how low eſteem the world hath of them, are the onely bleſſed men. 2. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Theirs is the Kingdom of God,</hi> it ſhews the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kingdom of God, and of men, for in earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms there is but one King, all the reſt are ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all are Kings, as the Sunne would not ſhine more on thee, though there were no more men in the world, ſo in heaven the multitude of poſſeſſors neither hinders nor diminiſheth one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abundance. 3. Whereas there is but one Kingdome and many to enjoy it; it ſhows that all ſhall have the ſame happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though haply not the ſame degree, as every one hath the ſame Sunne to look upon, though every one ſees it not equally, becauſe their ſights are not equally ſtrong, to behold it. 4. Theirs is, it may be ſaid to be theirs already, for the ſame reaſons that are mentioned for Bleſſed are. 5. Though the Kingdome of God hath many ſeveral ſignifications, yet here it may be taken eſpecially two wayes, 1. For the Goſpel, which may be ſaid to be the poors in ſpirit, 1. Becauſe it was intended on purpoſe for them, Chriſt was anointed, that is, Chriſt was Chriſt on purpoſe to preach the Goſpel to the poor, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none but they receive it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. 2. For the heaven of heavens, which is the place of the bleſſed, which is called the Kingdome of God, either becauſe God is immediately
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119918:33"/>King there, or becauſe of his ſpecial manifeſtation of his glory.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn]</hi> 1. It may be underſtood thus, that for a man to be in miſery, to mourn, is no certain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a man is not bleſſed, as the world generally eſteems it. 2. Not onely thoſe that mourn and lie under temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may be bleſſed, but they generally are the bleſſed men, for they that are afflicted and oppreſſed are good and holy men, wicked men generally live in all proſperity, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places of Scripture and continual experience do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. 3. But it holds in every particular true, if you adde that word in this Verſe which is in the former, <hi>viz. [in ſpirit]</hi> ſo whoſoever mourns ſpiritually, that is, for ſpiritual evils, and for their own and others ſins, imperfections of their graces, is a bleſſed man. 4. Here are ſet down ſome marks of true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>viz.</hi> That it muſt be an inward, ſerious and conſtant grief; and whereas we are commanded alwaies to rejoyce, and here notwithſtanding thoſe that mourn are called bleſſed, they do not contradict one the other, ſince mourning for ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the Lord, may very well ſtand together; nay thoſe who moſt mourn for ſins, do moſt rejoyce in the Lord; for he that is moſt grieved that he ows much, does moſt rejoyce in him that payes it for him, but he that rejoyces in his ſins, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rejoyce in the Lord; as of charity it is ſaid, It rejoyceth not in iniquity, but in the Lord who is Truth. 5. This is the coherence of this Beatitude with the former, they that are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own poverty of graces and goodneſſe, are alwaies great ſpiritual mourners; or thus, it is not ſufficient to ſee ones want of graces, except one mourns for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they ſhall be comforted]</hi> 1. Thus ſhews that the cauſe of their mourning ſhould be ſpiritual and not temporal; it muſt be ſuch, that the removal of it muſt make one bleſſed; and the removal of a temporal affliction, though it be a bleſſing, does not make him bleſſed from whom it is removed. 2. It is not ſaid who ſhall comfort him, but it is implied, that God ſhall comfort him, becauſe he muſt comfort him that is able to make him bleſſed, and none can make him bleſſed but God. 1. In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cauſes of mourning, as ſin, and the want of Gods preſence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119918:34"/>and the breathings after Heaven, none can comfort ſave onely God. 3. The time when they ſhall be comforted is not ſet down, to teach one alwaies to wait for it, yet the time is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which is death; for before that, thoſe that mourn never reſt from their labours, ſo they are never fully comforted; while then ſome cauſes of their mourning may ceaſe, but not all.</p>

It is not ſaid, Bleſſed are the courteous, but <hi>Bleſſed are the meek,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an eaſier thing to beſtow a courteſie, then to forgive an injury, the world alwaies commends the one, and counts the other generally puſillanimity. 3. There are two kinds of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as is partly intimated, the firſt makes us patient in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflictions from God, which makes us not to murmure; the other, which conſiſts in the bearing of injuries from men, and not revenge them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they ſhall inherit the Earth]</hi> Whereas divers will ſay, that the bearing of one injury is but the inviting of another, and ſo by many wrongs one ſhall be quite undone at laſt; Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, there is no ſuch matter, for none ſhall inherit the Earth but they that are meek; and indeed generally it coſts one more to revenge an injury, and one ſuffers more damage by it, then by the injury it ſelf. 2. <hi>They ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> may be taken two waies. 1. Either to ſhew that they that are meek do poſſeſſe the Earth by right of inheritance; others, wicked men, are but uſurpers. 2. Or to ſhew that they that are meek do poſſeſſe and quietly enjoy what they have, whereas thoſe that are furious and angry are ſo far from poſſeſſing the Earth, that they do not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe their own ſouls; for if patience makes one poſſeſſe ones ſoul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. then impatience puts one out of poſſeſſion.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſsed are they that do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe]</hi> 1. To hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe may be taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119918:34"/>waies, 1. For thoſe who ſuffering much wrong, and much deſire to have juſtice, as the widow <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. was importunate to be avenged, not revenged of her adverſaries. 2. Or elſe for thoſe, who ſeeing the Kingdome or place where they live full of violence and injuſtice, do earneſtly deſire the removal of it, and the reſtoring of juſtice. 3. And principally, which our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tranſlation does well import, for them that ſo earneſtly deſire grace and holineſſe, and to live godly in this preſent life. 2. It ſhews that our deſires after righteouſneſſe muſt not be faint, careleſſe, but earneſt, fervent, and inceſſant, ſuch as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt are, which of all natural deſires are the ſtrongeſt. 3. From the carriage of thoſe that hunger and thirſt, one may know whether one does, and how one ought to love and deſire righteouſneſs; for they that are very hungry and thirſty, 1. Care not what food will coſt them, rather then they will famiſh, they will give five pound for an Aſſes head, and ſix ſhillings and three pence for half a pint of Pigeons dung, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.25. 2. They reliſh their meat, even thoſe things that are bitter ſeem ſweet unto them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.7. but thoſe that do not hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, they finde no ſweetneſſe in it. 3. They are not curious nor dainty, nor need ſauce to make them eat, but any food that is wholſome comes welcome, it drowns all other deſires, they cannot think of nor do any thing before that be ſatisfied. 4. Our hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſſe doth argue a great want of righteouſneſſe, for indeed the more righteouſneſſe the more hunger and thirſt after it; for there is a double kinde of deſire, a deſire of want, and a deſire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence; ſome things we deſire becauſe we have them not, but when we have them we ſee ſo much vanity in them that we care not for them, ſuch are all worldly things; other things there be, of which the more we have, the more we deſire, and the not deſiring of them proceeds meerly from the ignorance of them; now that to hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, does not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue one quite void of righteouſneſſe, as in natural hunger it doth of food, is evident, becauſe an earneſt hungring and thirſtine after righteouſneſſe, is not onely an act, but an high degree of holineſſe: In earthly things the poſſeſſion of them takes away the deſire, but in ſpiritual things it increaſeth it. 5. It plainly ſhews that one cannot be ever holy enough in this life, but that ſtill we ſhould earneſtly deſire to be more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they ſhall be filled]</hi> 1. It ſhews that to be full of holineſſe is that wherein the very eſſence of bleſſedneſſe conſiſts, and that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119918:35"/>which makes Heaven Heaven, is becauſe that there dwelleth righteouſneſſe; for the exceeding love of God, which is the very ſoul of ſanctification, is the very thing that makes the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fruition of it ſo delightfull, and the being filled with righteouſneſſe could not argue them bleſſed, except to be filled with righteouſneſſe were true and eternal bleſſedneſſe. 2. It ſhews that true bleſſedneſſe is not an empty thing, as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the world is, it fils the ſoul that hath it. 3. It ſhews, if you take it excluſively, that none other ſhall be filled; for indeed the deſires of man being infinite, no creature can fill them.</p>

This is a double motive to ſhew mercy. 1. Becauſe it is rewarded, the mercy that we ſhew is not loſt, but we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after receive it with advantage. 2. Becauſe the greateſt motive of pitying or ſhewing mercy becauſe we or ours are in the like danger, therefore thoſe that are very miſerable, and ſo under all the calamities that they think can befal them, and thoſe that are in great proſperity, that think they are out of the reach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, are not pitifull to others; now that we need mercy, and ſo in the like calamity, as thoſe are we ſhew mercy unto, the very

This promiſe, as it is a ſutable motive to the duty to which it is annexed, ſo it is a ſutable motive to the condition wherein we are, for we being full of miſery and ſin, have the adequate objects of mercy, miſery to be relieved, and ſin to be pardoned. 4. It is not ſaid who ſhall ſhew us mercy, whether God or man, but it is true of both, for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mercifull men do receive mercy of men, but univerſally and infallibly from God, of whoſe mercy it is chiefly, if not onely meant, for none but his mercy can make them bleſſed.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers]</hi> This word here uſed in Greek for peace-makers, is hardly found in any profane Authour, and the meaning of the word is ſo plain, that it needs no Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They are to be accounted peace-makers, who make thoſe that are enemies or adverſaries friends, and ſo reſtore friendſhip that is loſt, or take up diſſentions and differences betwixt friends, and ſo preſerve that amity which is likely to be loſt. 1. Peace-makers and meek men differ thus, he is meek that keeps his anger from ariſing, or ſpeedily appeaſes it; ſo he is meek that moderates his own anger: but he is a peace-maker that moderates others. 2. Meekneſſe is a grace within us: but peace-making is an action without us. 3. A man may be a meek man, though he lives alone, ſequeſtred from the whole world, and hath no commerce with any one: but he cannot make peace, except he have ſome commerce with the parties whom he reconciles. 4. It is not alwaies neceſſary that he ſhould make thoſe friends whom he indeavours to reconcile, but whatſoever the event be, his deſires and indeavours be ſo to do, he is in the ſight of God accounted a peace-maker 1. Thoſe are exceedingly to be condemned who ſow diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong neighbours; and ſurely if the one be accounted the Sons of God, the other muſt be accounted the children of the Devil. 2.

The queſtion is, Whether all that are bleſſed muſt be perſecuted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, for every one that is bleſſed muſt be poor in ſpirit, meek, mourn? <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is not neceſſary that every one that ſhall be bleſſed ſhall be actually perſecuted, that is, ſuffer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, death, or ſome corporal puniſhment for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake; yet whoſoever ſhall not be willing to ſuffer all theſe for righteouſneſſe ſake, can never be bleſſed. Willing, I ſay, for a man may fear, that if perſecution ſhould ariſe, he ſhould not be able to ſuffer thoſe torments that he reads others have ſuffered, and yet notwithſtanding be a bleſſed man; for as the children of <hi>Ephraim, Pſal.</hi> 78.9. being armed, that is, going with courage to war, nay and at firſt fighting, for it is in the Hebrew, that they ſhot their Arrows out of their Bowes, and yet turned their backs. ſo on the contrary, divers children of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119918:37"/>God may go timorouſly to the ſtake, and when they come there they may ſhrink, and yet afterwards get the victory, and the glorious crown of Martyrdome. 4. <hi>For rightcouſneſſe ſake,</hi> for it is not the puniſhment, but the cauſe, that makes a man a Martyr, for if we ſuffer as evil doers, be our ſufferings never ſo great, God will never reward them. 5. All that are bleſſed do ſuffer ſome of thoſe kinds of perſecutions that are mentioned in the next Verſe, for the world does alwaies ſpeak evil of them, revile them, and ſtander them. 6. By this it is evident, that though wicked men pretend other reaſons of their perſecutions, yet the true reaſon why they perſecute them, is for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſſed are ye]</hi> Before our Saviour ſpoke thoſe things which are quite contrary to the opinion of the world, for they by no means count them bleſſed whom they perſecute, but here he ſets down that that is quite contrary to the opinion of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; for they thinking that the Meſſiah ſhould be a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral King, thought that they ſhould be ſo far from being perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that they ſhould have great preferment under him, our Saviour therefore tacitely ſhews them the falſhood of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by changing the perſon from the third to the ſecond; for whereas in the Verſe before he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they,</hi> &amp;c. left they ſhould think that they were not at all meant when our Saviour ſpoke of perſecution, here he comes home to them, and tells them in particular, that they ſhall be perſecuted, for it is ſtrongly intimated; for when it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are</hi> you, <hi>when men ſhall perſecute</hi> you, <hi>when men ſhall revile</hi> you, &amp;c. it is as much as, men ſhall perſecute and revile <hi>you,</hi> and ſhall ſpeak all manner of evil of <hi>you</hi> falſly for my names ſake. 2. Whereas it is here ſaid, <hi>ye,</hi> whereas in the Verſe before it is ſaid, <hi>they,</hi> it ſhews, that eſpecially in time of perſecution or great diſtreſſe, we muſt bring the promiſes of God home to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When men ſhall revile you]</hi> The word <hi>men</hi> is not in the Text in the Original, 1. May it not be to ſhew that they deſerve not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119918:37"/>the name of men; that perſecute any for Chriſts ſake? 2. Or elſe to ſhew that we ſhould not ſo much obſerve who it is that perſecutes us, as why we are perſecuted. 3. Or laſtly, to ſhew us not onely thoſe evils which we ſuffer from men, but thoſe which we ſuffer from Satan, ſhall turn to our great reward. 1. It is ſaid that when men ſhall perſecute you, you <hi>are</hi> bleſſed, not, You ſhall be bleſſed whom men ſhall perſecute; to ſhew that though perſecution do not inſtate one into Heaven, yet it intitles one unto Heaven ſo firmly, that by reaſon of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the promiſe, it is accounted as already received; to revile, is to uſe ſuch words as may make one deſpicable or odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not caring whether we ſpeak true or falſe, ſo one diſgraceth him whom we revile. It differeth from railing, 1. Railing is ſeldome or never but in many words, one may revile a man in one word. 2. Railing proceeds from anger, reviling from contempt; the word ſignifies ſo much, for to revile is to make one ſeem vile; reviling differs from ſlandering, the one ſtrives to make one ſeem vile and of no eſteem; ſlander, to make one to be accounted vitious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And perſecute you]</hi> Though under the name of perſecution in the Verſe before, is meant all evil whatſoever we ſuffer from men for righteouſneſſe, yet here not all manner of perſecution, but onely all manner of perſecution which is beſide that which the tongue may inflict upon us. Wicked men are to take notice that they muſt not think if they do not put to death or impriſon the people of God, that they are not to be put in the catalogue of perſecutors, for if they ſlander, nay if they ſpeak but ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of or to the Saints, nay if you ſpeak roughly to them, you ſhall be ſure to anſwer it at the day of judgement; for you ſee that revilers are put in the liſts of perſecutors, and <hi>Jude</hi> ſo, that at the day of judgement wicked men ſhall anſwer for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roughly to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 15.</p>

                     <hi>And ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you]</hi> All the evil that words can do to us, is to make us ſeem vile or vitious; of the former our Saviour hath already ſpoken, now he ſpeaks of the later.</p>

                     <hi>Falſely for my Names ſake]</hi> But leſt one ſhould think, to be ſpoke ill of, or perſecuted, is ſufficient to make one bleſſed, he adds two qualificatious, 1. That we are not guilty of thoſe things that are laid to our charge. 2. That it be for Chriſts ſake that we are ſo perſecuted; or 2.

We ought not onely to rejoyce in our ſelves, but outwardly not to be aſhamed to manifeſt it to others, for we are not to rejoyce or exalt, but to do both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For great is your reward in heaven]</hi> Three things there are in the words to make us be exceeding glad, 1. That we ſhall be rewarded. 2. That our reward ſhall be great. 3. That it ſhall not be an earthly, but an heavenly reward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For ſo perſecuted they the Prophets that were before you]</hi> For <hi>ſo</hi> perſecuted, that is, they reviled, perſecuted, and ſpoke all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil of them the Prophets, as appears in <hi>Eſay, Jeremy, Ezekiel,</hi> and by conſequence neither your perſecution, nor your manner of perſecution is a new thing, for <hi>ſo,</hi> &amp;c. and leſt the Apoſtles ſhould haply think, that ſurely the <hi>Jews</hi> could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſo wicked to perſecute the Apoſtles of the Meſſiah, he ſhews that before they had perſecuted the Prophets of God, and they that have already done the one, one may juſtly expect that they will do the other alſo. 3. But how can it be ſaid that they, that is, thoſe men that lived in our Saviours time, perſecuted the Prophets which were dead long before, eſpecially when they ſaid, that if they had lived in the daies of their fathers, they would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets; and ſo the perſecuting of the Prophets could not be imputed unto them; ſince they neither did it, nor conſented to it when it was done, nor approved of it after it was done? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That though they ſaid they would not have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with their fathers in the blood of the Prophets, and ſeem
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119918:38"/>not to approve of their doings, yet our Saviour that knew their hearts, and could not be deceived by their contrary profeſſion, told them and convinced them, that they did allow the works of their fathers, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.48. and the allowing of an action after it is done, makes one as guilty as the conſenting to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be done. 2. It is apparent that they were actually and perſonally guilty of the death of ſome of the Prophets, to wit, of <hi>Zachariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Barachiah, Matth.</hi> 23.32. and of <hi>John Baptist, Matth.</hi> 17.12. 3. Or they may be taken for the <hi>Jews,</hi> for theſe words are not here ſpoken to prove that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which then lived killed the Prophets, but to comfort the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they ſhould ſuffer the ſame perſecutions, by ſhewing them that they were not in worſe caſe then the Prophets before them were, and as the memorial of thoſe Prophets were preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among all good men, and their perſons glorious in Heaven, notwithſtanding they did revile, and perſecute, and ſpeak all manner of evil of them while they lived, ſo alſo ſhould it be with their memories and perſons, notwithſtanding men ſhould perſecute, revile, &amp;c.</p>

Or elſe thus, You muſt not wonder that wicked men perſecute you, for you are the ſalt of the earth, and therefore you are a great trouble to them, for they being full of ſpiritual wounds and ſores, you by your reprehenſions much vex them, as ſalt by its corroding nature, doth wounds and ſores into which it is put, and you vexing them, you muſt expect that they ſhould vex you.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119918:39"/>3. The Miniſters are like ſalt in many reſpects, 1. Salt makes all things ſavoury, and indeed if we will believe the Chymiſts, all taſts come from the ſeveral mixtures of ſalt. 2. Salt keeps all things from putrefaction, the earth and every man would putrifie and ſtink in the noſtrils of God, if the ſalt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Doctrine did not ſeaſon and preſerve them. 3. Salt is of a corroding nature, not pleaſing but ſmarting to any place that is raw or ſore. 4. Miniſters of all people are the worſt, if they have loſt their ſavour and are wicked, as ſalt is good for nothing if it have loſt its ſavour. 5. You may ſee here that onely to be morally good is not ſufficient, for if ſo, what need the Doctrine of the Apoſtles to ſeaſon them? moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy might do it. 6. You are more then the Prophets were, for they were the ſalt onely of the Jews, but you are the ſalt of the earth, not of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the ſalt have loſt its ſavour]</hi> It doth not prove or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſalt can loſe its ſavour, but onely ſhews what would follow if it ſhould; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven ſhould preach any other doctrine,</hi> he doth not ſay, nor can any prove from thence, that an Angel ever ſince hath, or ever ſhall go about to deceive. Two waies the words may be interpreted, 1. The Earth could not be ſalted. 2. Which is the proper ſignification and interpretation, the ſalt could not be ſalted with any thing, for if all the ſalt the Earth hath are the Apoſtles, how is it poſſible that if they ſhould loſe their ſavour, for them to be ſalted? for to ſay that that ſalt which hath loſt his ſavour may be ſalted by ſome other that hath not loſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſuppoſeth that the Apoſtles are not all, but ſome part of the ſalt of the earth: But if you ſhall ſay, that though it can ſalt nothing elſe, nor be ſalted it ſelf, yet it is good for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, our Saviour ſaith, no; for it is not onely not good for that which is its proper end, but for nothing elſe. A Chriſtian if he be as he ſhould be, is the beſt of men, but elſe worſe then beaſts, like the Vine, the fruitfulleſt of all Trees, but if bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, the moſt uſeleſſe, as the Prophet ſaith, one cannot make a pin ſtrong enough to hang any thing on.</p>

                     <hi>Ye are the light of the world]</hi> 1. Ye being the ſalt of a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nature to wicked men, and your reproofs cauſe them to perſecute you, and being light which manifeſts it ſelf and other things, you cannot be hid, for light of all things is the moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for a ſpark of fire is ſeen farther then any thing elſe of ten times the bigneſſe. 2. Ye are the light, one light for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was the ſame of all of them, ſo it ſhews the unity of their doctrine. 3. They and we ſhould be like light, 1. It is the ſpeedieſt in communicating it ſelf, in a moment it goes from one end of the heavens to the other, Miniſters ſhould be diligent. 2. Light doth no hurt, it penetrates glaſſe but it doth not break it; ſo the doctrine of the Apoſtles, Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, doth not hurt any profeſſion, but makes it more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the childe is more obedient, the Subject more loyal. 3. Thoſe rooms in which one can diſcern no uncleanneſſe in, in darkneſſe, when the light comes the uncleanneſſe is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which make wicked men to love darkneſſe better then light, becauſe they cannot endure to ſee or have others ſee their pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 4. Though the light ſhine upon a dunghill it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, it diſcovers to all the filthineſſe of the place; ſo Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould not be defiled with the ſins they diſcover.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is called the light, and the Apoſtles are called the light of the world, but differently; for Chriſt is as the Sunne, but the Apoſtles as they are called, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. like a Candle or Torch, and they differ,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of unity, there is but one Chriſt but many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters, there is but one Sunne but many candles or torches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of purity, the light of a candle is mixt with ſmoke, but the light of the Sunne hath no mixture of ſmoke or darkneſſe. So the knowledge of the Apoſtles is mixt with ignorance, and the Miniſters with ſome errour, not ſo Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Sunne hath light from it ſelf, not borrows it from another, but a candle or torch receives its light, ſo the Apoſtles receive their doctrine from Chriſt. Further the Apoſtles are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119918:40"/>called the light of the world, to diſtinguiſh them from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which preached only to the Jews, but they to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo.</p>
                  <p>It diſtinguiſhes alſo the Goſpel that the Apoſtles preached from the light of nature &amp; reaſon, notwithſtanding that the world was in darkneſſe as to ſaving knowledge; and that the Apoſtles might not think that they either could or ſhould be hid whatſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions will ariſe; Chriſt brings two ſimilies, one of a City, another of a Candle. The Church is compared to a City,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew the largeneſſe of it, and therefore it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Village, but to a City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew that it ought to have its Government within it ſelf, although the Civil State have power over the Church in reſpect of Civil Government and Cenſures, yet in reſpect of Church-officers and Cenſures the Church hath power in it ſelf to ordain the one, and inflict the other. Petty villages are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally governed by officers without them, but Cities by officers within themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Further the Church is compared to a City.</p>
                  <p>No man lights a candle, 1. No man, that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o wiſe man; another ſpeech like this is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils. Quod jure non poſsumus habetur pro impoſſibili,</hi> ſo, <hi>Quod à ſapiente fieri non poteſt habetur pro impoſſibili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The coherence ſeems to be this, You moſt expect to be perſecuted as all the Prophets were, and the reaſon is becauſe you moſt reprove ſin, and you being the lights of the world, thoſe that love darkneſſe cannot but hate you. For if you ſhall think with your ſelf, I, but we will if perſecution ariſes retire our ſelves and not preach the Goſpel, but that will be quite againſt you being as Apoſtles and Preachers, for it were all one for you not to have thoſe gifts of edification, as not to uſe them; as a candle had as good not be lighten, as being lighten to be put under a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel, and I ſhal do as no wiſe man does if I ſhould enable you with that knowledge whereby you ſhould be enabled to give light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and they will bid you not communicate it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Miniſters may be compared to Candles or Torches, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have their light from another, not from themſelves, as the Sun hath. 2. A Candle is good for nothing except it be light. 3. As a Candle waſteth it ſelf by giving light to others, ſo the labours of Miniſters do much ſpend them, inſomuch that Chriſt in reſpect of his labour in the Miniſtry ſeemed to be ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119918:40"/>year old when he was but thirty. 4. Thoſe that perſecute Miniſters may ſee what miſchief they bring upon themſelves, he that blows out the Candle muſt expect to ſit in the dark. 5. A Miniſter by not communicating his light and exerciſing his gifts takes the ready way to loſe them, as a Candle, not having vent and air goes out of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhews thus much, that all Miniſters ought to have knowledge, that is, to be enlightned before they can be ſet up in any Candleſtick, as it is to no purpoſe to ſet up a Candle in a Candleſtick, except it be enlightned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every one that hath gifts fit for the edifying of others, ought to be ſet in a Candleſtick (that is) placed in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where they may exerciſe their gifts, but they muſt not ſet themſelves in a Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By Candleſticks apparently are meant Churches, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A Miniſter muſt not be partial, nor an accepter of perſons, he muſt give light to all that are in the houſe, inſtruct the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as well as the greateſt, and the greateſt as well as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Some will comfort rich people when they are in afflictions, and be very earneſt in reproving the faults of the meaner ſorts, but they muſt alſo reprove the greateſt and comfort the meaneſt, for light is taken for comfort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. and for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119918:41"/>3. Let us ſee what might probably induce them to think that our Saviour came to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, 1. For the Law, our Saviour did not preach, nor did his Sermon go, as the Law did, by way of command, for he doth not ſay, <hi>Be ye poor in Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. but by way of promiſe, <hi>Bleſsed are the poor in Spirit.</hi> 2. Nor is there in all the beatitudes one of the ten Commandments, in plain terms, or ſo many words, not Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that keep the Sabbath, or that honour their Father and Mother. 2. For the Prophets, he ſeemed to deſtroy them, for as they thought the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come in pomp and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and that his Kingdom ſhould be of this world, yet he ſaid he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> though he was poor. 2. He did not as all the reſt of the Prophets did, denounce judgement to come as yet, nor told of things to come, and indeed in all reſpects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt his preaching was different from that of the Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfill]</hi> 1. Obſerve that ones actions, preaching, doctrine, may be miſ-interpreted, quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> not onely <hi>divers,</hi> for though our Saviour came to fulfill, he was thought that he did come to deſtroy. 2. Let us ſee how our Saviour did not deſtroy the Law, for it may ſeem that he did: 1. For the moral Law he did not deſtroy that, the end, vertue and power of the moral Law, was 1. To ſet down a rule or way to heaven, and to ſhew us what we were to do to glorifie God, and to benefit our neighbour, and to attain heaven. 2. To juſtifie thoſe that kept it, and to ſave them. 3. A condemning power to ſentence them that kept it not: for the two former ends they ſtill remain; for the Law hath yet a power to juſtifie thoſe who keep it, and to ſave them; that it doth not actually juſtifie us, is becauſe we cannot fulfill it by reaſon of any weakneſſe in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. Food hath a power to nouriſh, though by reaſon of the weakneſſe of the ſtomack it cannot digeſt, or of the vicious humours that putrifie and corrupt the food it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives: but for the condemning power, is not that taken away, ſince divers that keep not the Law are not condemned? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. That the condemning power of the Law is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial but accidental to the Law; ſo that the Law may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed though none be condemned by it; nay though it hath no power to condemn; for the main intention of Law-givers, is not that men ſhould be puniſhed for not keeping, but that men ſhould keep them, for the penalty is not ſet down as a ſnare to entrap men, but as a motive to provoke men to keep them.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119918:42"/>2. The Law hath ſtill a condemning power, and actually doth condemn all thoſe who do not evangelically keep it, thoſe who are condemned are condemned by the Law. 3. He hath for thoſe who believe in him, not aboliſht the power to condemn, but ſatisfied the condemning power, and endured the penalty of the Law, for he did not by force, but by ranſom deliver the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives of ſinne and death; for the ceremonial Law Chriſt might not be properly ſaid to deſtroy that, for when any thing attains the very end for which it was ordained, though it periſh in ſo doing, it cannot properly be ſaid to be deſtroyed; for inſtance, food, the end of it is to nouriſh, though it be conſumed and corrupted in the ſtomack from the form it had, yet it is not ſaid to be deſtroyed; as for example, A leaſe for lives is not properly cancelled or deſtroyed, but expired by the death of the parties; Prophecie, when the thing comes to paſſe, is not nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or deſtroyed, but fulfilled, though it ceaſe to be any longer a Prophecy. Ceremonies of the Law were viſible Prophecies of Chriſt, for the Jews being a ſuperſtitious people, and by conſequence loved Ceremonies, and God fore-ſeeing that they would if they were not framed to their hands, ſtuff their ſervice of God with idolatrous ceremonies, the Lord ſet down and choſe for them ſuch Ceremonies, as might (as much as Ceremonies could) profit them, giving them ſuch Ceremonies as ſhould prefigure the main and moſt remarkable things of the <hi>Meſſiast</hi> when Chriſt came he fulfilling all thoſe viſible Prophecies and Types of him could by no means be ſaid to deſtroy the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, but to fulfill it; for the judicial Law, it belonged not to the Jews as they were a Church, but as a Commonwealth, and ſo our Saviours Kingdome not being of this world, he did no way alter thoſe Laws, for the Jewiſh Commonwealth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them more or leſſe ſtrict then they were, nor impoſed them upon other Kingdoms of the world. 2. Chriſt fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, 1. The Moral Law more perfectly then ever it could have been fulfilled, 1. Fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Law, by his active obedience more exactly, or at leaſt in an higher degree, then <hi>Adam</hi> could have done, or then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do; for although the Angels do, and <hi>Adam</hi> if he had ſtood in his integrity, would have exactly fulfilled the Law, he would, and the Angels do love God with all their ſtrength, and minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet their righteouſneſſe neither is nor could have been ſo excellent as our Saviours; for the minde of our Saviour being more clear, and the ſtrength of our Saviour more then theirs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119918:42"/>our Saviour loved God more excellently ſince he loved him with all his ſtrength and all his minde. A childe though it put all its ſtrength to it, cannot lift ſo much as a Gyant. 2. For the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law our Saviour by his paſſive obedience fulfilled and ſatisfied that more then any way it is, or could be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the damned in hell do not ſo exactly fulfill and ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the breach of the Law, for they are alwayes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, but never do, nor never ſhall actually and fully ſatisfie the ſame; for if they did, or ever ſhould, they ſhould then ceaſe any longer to be tormented, for then the torments of hell ſhould not be eternal: Now our Saviour did, and actually hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the juſtice of God, and hath paid the uttermoſt farthing for the dignity of his perſon, made thoſe ſufferings which were finite both in time and degree of torment, of infinite merit; for the Ceremonial Law and the Prophets, he hath ſo abſolutely fulfilled them more then any other way they could be fulfilled, that except he had fulfilled them they could never have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, not any one thing or circumſtance is there that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, or typified by the Law, which he hath not exactly performed; Chriſt hath alſo fulfilled the Moral Law by making it more full, not by adding more ſtrict pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of holineſſe then the Law hath, but by giving the full meaning.</p>

The Scribes and Phariſees breaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and teaching men ſo to do; and ſince they ſhould not enter that break and teach men ſo to do, it ſhews and proves by inſtance, that he that breaks one of the Commandments, and teacheth men ſo to do, ſhall not come into the Kingdome of heaven. 2. Obſerve that the learnedeſt men in the world, may and ſhall if they do not live holily, periſh, for the Scribes were the expounders of the Law. 2. Though men be never ſo ſtrict in their lives for outward mortifications, except they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſincerely holy, it will not profit them. 3. Though all men applaud one, yet one may be an extream wicked man, for all the Jews applauded the Phariſees. 4. Though one hold the right for matter of opinion, as the Phariſees did in matters of the reſurrection, yet one may go to hell: It is a ſtrange thing that the Sadduces who held an opinion utterly deſtructive of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſhould not withſtanding not be ſo much condemned of wickedneſſe as the Phariſees were. 5. It is not ſaid, Your righteouſneſſe muſt exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Law and Prophets, as the Socinians and others would have, but of the Scribes and Phariſees. 6. The Scribes being the great men for expounding the Law, and the Phariſees ſo much applauded for holineſſe, and ſo for keeping the Law; our Saviour ſhews that the one were out for matter of doctrine, and the other for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of practice.</p>
                  <p>Our righteouſneſſe muſt exceed the righteouſneſſe of Scribes and Phariſees, 1. In reſpect of kinde, they preached up onely inherent righteouſneſſe which is by the works of the Law, but by the works of the Law no man living ſhall be judged, but we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119918:44"/>muſt have the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed unto us. The holineſſe alſo which they preached and practiſed was defective many wayes, 1. It was not extenſive and univerſal in each: 1. In reſpect of the Commandments they preached, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the breach of ſome, of many of them, as appears <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.23. 2. As ſome Commandments they did aboliſh by their doctrine, ſo thoſe which they did not aboliſh, but preached up, their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition extended not to the full ſcope of the Law; for it only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the outward man, and not wholly to that neither, for they did not think that by words one might break the ſixth Commandment, as by this Chapter appears. 2. As our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience muſt be more univerſal, ſo it muſt be more conſtant. 3. It muſt be more ſincere, they failed in the grounds, ends and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their duty.</p>

Or, 2. Of the words immediately going before, and then it ſtands thus, Except your righteouſneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſſe which the Scribes and Phariſees do or teach, you cannot enter, for ye have heard from them, that he that kils ſhall be in danger of judgement, but they never preſſed upon you not to be angry, or that ſcornfull carriage or pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or opprobrious words were ſins. Obſerve the practice of all falſe prophets is to plead antiquity and traditions. 2. That though they do plead antiquity yet falſly, for though the Scribes plead that it was ſaid thus and thus of old time, yet there was no ſuch thing ſpoken of old, but the contrary, or at leaſt if it be ſpoken of old, it is not in their ſenſe; for our Saviour does not ſay, that it was ſaid of old, but you have heard that it was ſaid of old. 2. The opinion of thoſe that ſay, that Chriſt gave a new Law to Chriſtians, and that the Law which he gave and gives to Chriſtians, did not binde the Jews, nor was ſet down in Old Teſtament, againſt which opinion theſe things may be ſaid, 1. That the ſtricteſt of the precepts that Chriſt gives
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119918:44"/>here may be found in the Old Teſtament, as this 22. verſ. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17, 18. that 28. verſ. <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6 25. 2. The many and great praiſes of the Laws perfection and purity, that <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in innumerable places ſets down, which could not belong to it except thoſe precepts were expreſſed or included in the Law. 3. The coherence of theſe words with the former, and they who would have theſe words not a confutation of the falſe gloſſes of the Scribes, do not acknowledge any coherence of theſe words with the former, your righteouſneſſe muſt exceed either what the Phariſees practice, or the Scribes teach, or elſe you ſhall not enter; to prove that he tels them here, and ſets down their doctrine, and then what is the right, firſt what they teach, and then how we muſt exceed. 4. It is ſaid, you have heard, not that you have read ſo, for their falſe gloſſes have told you this, not the text; if you reade you may reade otherwiſe, he doth not ſay, that they of old time writ ſo, but that you have heard that they of old time have ſaid ſo. 5. If the meaning ſhould be that they of old time had ſaid ſo, and that the Old Teſtament had ſaid ſo, then ſhould all thoſe things which our Saviour ſaith, That they had heard were ſaid of them of old times, be found in ſome place of Scripture, but they are found in no place of Scripture; for neither are thoſe words, He that kils ſhall be in danger of the judgement, nor thoſe words, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy, found in this ſenſe, though in other words, but the contrary for ſenſe; <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> is the righteonſneſſe of the Phariſees and of the Scribes, but now our Saviour ſets down how we ought to exceed them, if ever we will hope to enter into the kingdom of heaven, for ſo it follows.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119918:45"/>flows, to wit, anger; to ſhew us that as in this, and ſo in all other ſins the beginnings are to be prevented or reſiſted, nay not only the beginnings of ſinne, which have the nature of ſin, and diſter but in degree from the higheſt act, as anger differs but in degree from murder, it is of the ſame kinde, but the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſinne which are not formally, but only occaſionally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therefore one is not bound alwayes to avoid the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne, but alwayes the beginnings of ſinne. From this we may learn, That the very firſt motions of ſinne are ſinne, and deſerve eternal death; for though anger never breaks forth in geſtures, words, much leſſe in actions, it makes one guilty before God, and liable to judgement. Further, that we ought to look not only to our actions but to our words, nay to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry geſtures, nay further of our thoughts. Further, It is good to take ſuch places of Scripture as theſe which are very plain and concern actions of ordinary occurrence, which children may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily take notice of, and teach them our children, as for example, teach our children, <hi>Whoſoever cals his brother fool is in danger of hell ſire.

Or it was, that becauſe the puniſhments had they been as great as the ſin deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, men would have accounted God cruel. Or, 3. God would have men puniſh the offences done againſt them, no more then proportionably to the damage they ſuffer, as for the offence as it reflects upon him (in which reſpect only it deſerves ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy a puniſhment, as our Saviour there mentions) he will reſerve the puniſhment of that to the laſt day, and to himſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Agree with thine adverſary]</hi> Concerning our friends, while there is no difference betwixt us, there needs no inſtruction, the <hi>Publicans</hi> not only will tell you what to do, but by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they teach you, they do what is to be done in this caſe, they love their friends, but that wherein they tranſgreſſe both in their life and doctrine, is concerning three ſorts of perſons, a friend that is fallen out with thee, an adverſary that ſues thee, and an enemy that hates thee; be reconciled to thy brother, leſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thine adverſary, agree with thine adverſary leſt he become thine enemy, and love thine enemy, that he may become thy friend. 2. An adverſary is a perſon of a middle nature between a friend and an enemy, for an offended friend becomes an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and an offended adverſary becomes thine enemy; and an adverſary and an enemy differ. Firſt, an adverſary his end is, 1. To recover his own to do himſelf good, but an enemies aim is to do thee hurt. 2. An adverſary makes the Law his rule, and the Law his judge, but thine enemy makes his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice his rule, and himſelf the judge. 3. Thine adverſary is far eaſier to be made thy friend, divers times a ſmall part of thine eſtate will ſerve, but thine enemy will not be ſatisfied but with thy ruine; therefore our Saviour doth not bid thee be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thine enemy, for thine enemies are generally implacable, and whoſoever is ones enemy, was firſt onely an offended bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or an adverſary, and thou haſt or ſhouldſt have ſtriven to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119918:48"/>be reconciled before; but all that our Saviour requires in that caſe, is to pray, bleſſe, love. 3. Agree, that is, indeavour to agree, for it is not alwaies in our power to agree, as it is not alwaies in our power to be reconciled. 4. Do not ſay, He hath done me wrong, and ſues me unjuſtly, let him come and agree with me, but our Saviour bids thee agree with him; for indeed Chriſt bids thee, and God commands thee, to do no more then he hath done himſelf, for ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 5.10. 5. Or at leaſt thou art bound not to bear any evil will, but to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. 6. Not with Gods adverſary, thou art not bound to agree with him, if any one ſhall perſecute thee for righteouſneſſe ſake, though thou knoweſt he will deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge to the Officer, and they caſt thee into priſon, yet thou art bound to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to bear him no ill will, but to pray for him, as you have it in this Chapter. 7. The adverſary, as I ſuppoſe here meant, is one that ſues thee for debt, for there are but two things for which we ſue, injuries, debts; if thou haſt injured thy brother, the former advice is proper, <hi>If thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, go thy wayes, and be reconciled unto him;</hi> if he ſues thee for debt, <hi>Make an agreement with him,</hi> is more proper then <hi>Be reconciled,</hi> for oft times one may ſue thee, who is not at all fallen out with thee. Again, that here is meant one that ſues thee for debt, appears by this, that it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not come out thence, before thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing.</hi> 8. Some will not have this ſaying to be meant at all literally, but, That we having by our ſins made God our adverſary, we ought quickly, while we live, before death come, to agree with him, leſt, &amp;c. the reſt of the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is eaſily made up; they ſay that it is not convenient that Chriſt would deſcend ſo low, as to give directions againſt the remporal damages which come by Law-ſuits: Yet I conceive that it may be meant literally, 1. Becauſe elſe the words can have no coherence with the former, or if that were made by invention of wit and learning, what but may be made to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to any thing? yet ſurely their reaſon doth not hold, for Chriſt ſpeaks of lower things then of the miſchiefs that come by going to Law; for where he ſpeaks of upper rooms, he tels them, and bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them take the loweſt room; not that Chriſt intended to teach man how to be honoured by men, which he in other places blames, but to ſhew them how abſurd they are, and how contrary waies they take for the accompliſhing of the ends they aim at, for if the world be honoured, they ſhould do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119918:48"/>quite contrary to what they did; ſo here he ſhews, that the vain hopes of prevailing in the ſuit ſhould not make us go on in our ſuit, but agree, &amp;c. leſt, that is, he may prevail ſo, as to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee to the Judge, the Judge may, &amp;c. 9. Do not ſay he will and doth demand too much, 1. Conſider, thou maiſt loſe the cauſe, be the cauſe never ſo juſt, for bribes and other things may carry the cauſe againſt juſtice. 2. The charges of the ſuit will haply be more then the terms he propoſeth for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. 3. The vexations and troubles of the ſuit are very conſiderable. 4. The time thou ſpendeſt is very precious, thou maiſt ſpend it far better. 5. The ſins of uncharitableneſſe of thee towards him, and of him towards thee, are of the greateſt moment, which haply thou doſt leaſt conſider. 10. I ſhall not exclude the other interpretation which is made, more likely to be the meaning of the words, becauſe our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt not come out,</hi> &amp;c. for our Saviour doth not ſo earneſtly affirm any thing, which doth not concern things greater then earthly things are, and indeed that which doth make me incline to that interpretation, not onely as one, but as the onely interpretation, is, that whatſoever our Saviour ſo earneſtly affirms, is univerſally and in every particular true; whereas it is not in every particular true, that every one who hath not agreed with their adverſary, but hath been caſt into priſon, hath been made to pay the uttermoſt farthing; and it holds true of every one that is caſt into hell, therefore now of the words in that ſenſe. 11. We are wiſhed to agree with him, for there is no queſtion but he will agree with us, for he wiſheth us to agree with him, and we do not uſe to wiſh any to agree with us, if we are unwilling to agree with him. 12. No ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth agree with God, not in his opinions, for he cals evil good, and good evil, truth falſhood, and falſhood truth; nor in his actions, for he doth that which is contrary to his law, which is his will, and ſurely that which agrees not with that ſtraight rule, muſt needs be crooked. 13. Thou ſeeſt thou art to expect from God a legal proceeding, he is thine adverſary, not thine enemy. If you ſhall ſay that it is all one to have an arbitrary government, as for him that governs to make the laws whereby he governs, I anſwer, 1. That it is not, for if there are laws to rule us, and he that rules will obſerve them, then one knows what to do to avoid puniſhment, whereas if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were purely arbitrary, then no man knows what he is to do or ſuffer, if there are no laws that ſet it down. If you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119918:49"/>ſhall ſay that all Gods Laws, as all his Works, are made for the advancement of his own glory and prerogative, I anſwer, That God creating all things ſo, making all his Laws ſo, that his great Name, that is, his Attributes, may be known and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as all his works are created; ſo that his goodneſſe to the creature is more apparent then any other of his Attributes, and as Gods wiſdome in the works of the creation is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, his power in creating every part of every creature, ſo that it may be moſt for the profit of the creatures, and every creature ſo, that it may beſt ſerve for the uſe of the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo he hath made his Laws ſo, that they may be for the greateſt behoof of man, for God ſeeks the glory of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and would have his goodneſſe magnified as much, if not more then his power or wiſdome; therefore he doth not mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his power onely, but to thoſe that firſt have deſpiſed his goodneſſe. If a King did account the liberty, welfare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Subjects his greateſt honour, if this King were wiſer then all his Subjects, an arbitrary Government were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely beſt for the people, and that none ſhould make Laws but the King; thus it is with God.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119918:50"/>the looking upon a woman to luſt after her is forbidden, if not by precept, by the example of <hi>Job</hi> 31.16. and not onely example but the expreſſe words of Scripture doth impute adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the eyes; ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.16. for the farther obſervations from theſe words, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>

                     <hi>Who ſo looketh upon a woman]</hi> Two things there were haply that the Scribes and Phariſees mainly erred in, in their gloſſe upon theſe words, 1. They haply expound the words onely of adultery, and excluded fornication from being by this Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, for it appears by their writings that for any one to abuſe a captive taken in warre was accounted lawful. Or, 2. They thought that only the outward act of adultery was adultery; if you ſhall ſay, How could they not condemn the deſire of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife, ſince the very Law condemns it in the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? I anſwer, that you muſt underſtand that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring their neighbours wife was, when any one deſired that his neighbours wife ſhould be their wife, as their deſiring their neighbours ſervant, was to have him to be their ſervant, and upon this their deſiring the woman, ſhe was willing and would ſo carry her ſelf, that her husband ſhould give her a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and then he that before deſired her, married her, and thought it lawfull, which our Saviour before he leaveth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this point condemns for adultery, for he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this treats of divorce, for by that he farther explains and confirms this matter. Now haply the Scribes and Phariſees did only expound the tenth Commandment to be meant of deſiring another mans wife from him. Or, 2. If they did account it a ſinne, they accounted it not ſo great a ſinne as to judge it adultery, for they haply did not think adultery could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the heart; our Saviour chiefly ſeems to convince them of their errour in thinking that only the outward act, not the deſire of adultery, is adultery, as may appear by the word luſt after. 3. Looketh, not only looking, but all other unchaſte carriages, ſpeech or actions are forbidden much more, for to look upon a woman is the loweſt degree or act. 4. A woman it may be taken two wayes, either to ſhew the Sex, and ſo it is oppoſed to man, and the ſenſe then is againſt the firſt errour condemning onely adultery, not fornication; for if you take the word thus, it runs thus, You think that only the abuſing of another mans wife is forbidden, but I ſay, <hi>that who ſo looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a woman,</hi> let her be married or unmarried, the Sex makes one guilty. Or, 2. It may be taken for the ſtate or condition of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119918:50"/>the perſon ſo luſted after, and indeed the Greek word ſignifies <hi>woman,</hi> as woman is oppoſed to maid, and then the emphaſis is to be placed in looketh to luſt, condemning not onely the act but the deſire. 3. Not only one who lives with her husband, but one that is divorced is meant, for whoſoever cannot lawfully be married, cannot lawfully be deſired, but a woman that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced cannot lawfully be married, <hi>v.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To luſt after her]</hi> 1. Elſe to look upon her is no ſinne. 2. To look upon a woman to luſt after her, may be taken in a double ſenſe, 1. He that looketh and his looking ends in luſting, or he looks whiles at laſt he luſteth. Or, 2. When the end or intent of his looking is to enflame his luſt, the former way, his looking is not ſinfull, or at leaſt not at firſt, untill it hath produced that evil effect, but the ſecond way, the very looking it ſelf is ſinfull, at firſt, ſince it is done to ſo wicked an end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.]</hi> 1. It is not ſaid he will commit, for his looking on her, and the luſting after her, may and is likely to be the occaſion of the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of corporal adultery, but it is the very commiſſion of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery before God, and this adultery of the heart differs from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adultery, 1. It may be committed the woman being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing. 2. It may be committed alone. 3. It brings no guilt upon the woman with whom one commits it. 4. It is not ſo bad, for though it be the ſame kinde of ſinne, to wit, adultery, yet it is not the ſame degree of ſinne. 2. So you ſee the anſwer to an Objection, to wit, If to deſire a woman be adultery, then as good commit corporal adultery; no, for corporal adultery, though it be the ſame kinde, yet not the ſame but an higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. 2. Though corporal adultery were a leſſe ſinne, yet ſince it is impoſſible to commit corporal; but he muſt commit mental too, but not contrary, doubtleſſe to commit corporal is worſe to commit mental: though four be more then two, yet four and two be more then four alone, he that ſhould ſay, Since he that breaks one Commandment is guilty of all, therefore I had as good break all, ſingle, one by one, as one only: No, for he that breaks one Commandment ſingly, breaks all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments but once; but he that breaks all the Commandments ſingly one by one, breaks all ten times. 3. He that commits cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adultery makes himſelf guilty of her ſinne with whom he commits adultery. 3. It is not ſaid, they have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or that ſhe hath committed adultery with him, but he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119918:51"/>with her; for though in ſome caſes, as if a woman by her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or geſture carries and dreſſeth her ſelf ſo looſly and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as may give juſt cauſe of ſuch unlawfull deſires, ſhe is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſinne, and if ſhe doth it to that end ſhe commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with him in her heart, but if he luſt after her he alwayes commits adultery with her. 4. Before the Scribes did erre in the puniſhment due to ſins, here in the very nature of the ſinne: there they thought the puniſhment due to ſins leſſe then indeed it was, here they think the ſinne leſſe. 5. You will ſay, Why did not the Law forbid looking upon a woman to luſt after her, but forbids committing adultery? 1. Might it not be becauſe that would be too ſtrict for them to bear away at that time, therefore he puts a word that might and would very well include, but did not plainly expreſſe ſo much: and if you ſhall ſay, Why did he give the Commandments of the firſt Table in ſuch high and ſtrict terms, forbidding the loweſt, or very near the loweſt ſins of the ſeveral kindes, as in the ſecond and third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Was it not becauſe they could better bear ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in the worſhip of God, becauſe they were uſed to a kinde of niceneſſe or extremity (if I may ſo call it) in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or piety, for they were very ſuperſtitious, and ſuperſtition is to piety, as fondneſſe is to love, though irregular, yet ſomewhat extream. Our Saviour therefore inſtanceth there in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not in the ſinne. 6. If you ſhall farther ask, Why our Saviour inſtanceth here in the ſinne, and doth not here ſet down the puniſhment? I anſwer, that our Saviour doth ſet down the puniſhment, it is fully intimated in thoſe words following, <hi>It is better that one member ſhould periſh, then that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If thou committeſt adultery, thy whole body muſt be caſt into hell.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the ſenſe, and the other the member of the body, which are inſtruments and occaſions of making us guilty of the ſinne above ſpecified, ſuch wayes, that the Scribes did not teach. 2. Becauſe the eye and the hand are the deareſt, and chiefeſt of all the members of the body, the one for knowledge, and the other for action, the eye the chiefeſt of all the ſenſes, for the abſence of the object of ſight, of light breeds terrour in us, for darkneſſe breeds a kinde of horrour, but ſilence the abſence of ſound is not at all dreadful. 2. The eye is the beautifulleſt part of the body, nay the very ſeat of beauty. Other excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies might be given, but theſe belong to the buſineſſe in hand, the hand alſo is of great excellency and great uſe, for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to man; and the reaſon why for a man to be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offenſive or defenſive weapons and naked without clothes, is better then to have both, as divers beaſts have, is becauſe God hath given man hands, whereby he may make uſe of what kinde of each he pleaſe, and as long as he pleaſe, ſo that neither may be when he hath no uſe of them a trouble to him, all kinde of handycraft trades, which are of all the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the world, were not poſſible to be performed without the hand, the hand therefore and the eyes are named, to ſhew that nothing ought to be ſo delightful, or ſo uſeful, but we ought to part with it for heaven, and the ſervice of God. 5. But why ſhould not the heart which is the part that commits adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be pulled out, and caſt from a man, but the eye which is the window that lets in the object that enticeth? I anſwer, 1. May it not be to ſhew that if occaſions and temptations cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119918:52"/>ſinne would alſo ceaſe, the fire will go out if you adde no more fewel to it? 2. To ſhew that we are not to lay violent hands upon our ſelves, and kill our ſelves, one may live without the eye and hand. Thoſe things that are abſolutely neceſſary unto life, muſt not be left, though there be occaſions of ſinning, though food and raiment ſhould occaſion us to ſinne, we are not therefore to leave them off, for by hand and eye are meant ſuch things as a man may live without, for neither of thoſe two are vital parts, ſuch as if we are deprived of we die. Or, 6 The Queſtion may be, Whether a man may muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or diſmember himſelf, pull out his eye, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> I anſwer, 1. That if you take the words thus, they do not argue for muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to wit, if thine eye or hand offend thee, and there be no other way, then pull the one out, and cut the other off, but no man but may by Gods help ſo govern the eye and hand that they may not cauſe him to ſinne, if it ſhould be ſo that he could not, then cut it off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. But for the Queſtion farther, That our Saviour doth not mean it here, ſeems by this apparent, becauſe the pulling out the right eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would do no good, for the left eye will ſee as much as the right, nay as much as both, and that which further ſeems againſt it, is that we have not the example of any Chriſtian, who did pull out their eyes, or cut off their hand. 7. Thou mayeſt not if anothers right eye offend thee pull it out; if any womans beauty do entice thee to luſt after her, thou mayeſt not deface her beauty, what is thine own thou mayeſt diſpoſe of, to thine own beſt ſpiritual advantage, but not that which is another mans. 8. You may not wonder that thy ſervants, thy children rebell againſt thee, for the parts of thine own body rebell againſt thee, thy very eyes may be caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thine ears doors to let in thine enemies unto thy ſoul. 9. But why thy right eye? we ſee as much with one eye as with the other; nay indeed with one as with both? I anſwer, The right eye of the two is the moſt uſeful, and that apparently in warre, for moſt men being right-handed, impoſſible it is to take aim with ones left eye, ſhooting with the right hand, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bow with the right hand, therefore 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Nahaſh</hi> would thruſt out all the right eyes of the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> that they might be made unfit for ever fighting againſt him; for when the right eye is out, one can only ſhoot at a venture; of the uſefulneſſe of the right hand above the left, nothing need be ſaid, it is ſo apparent. 10. But why doth our Saviour inſtance but in one eye, and in one hand; for, 1. Since he ſpeaks but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119918:52"/>of one, as good ſpeak of none, for one eye if not one hand will do as much harm as both. 2. It ſeems that if both ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, one ſhould pull out both, 1. Might it not be becauſe it could not be ſaid, cut them off (and from that expreſſion there is a very good leſſon to be learned, as ſhall be obſerved) for when one hand is off, one cannot ones ſelf cut off the other? 2. Or was it for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 13.6. it is not ſaid <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> but <hi>if thy brother the ſonne of thy mother;</hi> for if one ſhould reveal them and bring them to puniſhment, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> one ſhould bring any one elſe to puniſhment; ſo if thou ſhould cut off thy right hand, no queſtion thy left, if that ſhall before or after offend thee. 3. It includes it in this caſe alſo, if thou haſt but one eye, and that be thy right eye, and ſo but one hand, thou art to pull it out, and cut it off. 4. Or if thou art <hi>à for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> to cut off thy left hand, after that be cut off, and thine other hand offend thee, and ſo it is all and in ſome reſpects bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then if he had ſaid both. 5. Or is it not to ſhew that for thoſe things without, which we could not be without almoſt, an inſupportable inconvenience would come on us, we are not bound to deprive our ſelves of them, but ſome way to take the beſt order to keep them from offending, but though the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience be much that we ſuffer, we are to abide it rather then to keep what cauſeth us to offend, for to be deprived of both eyes or both hands, the miſchief is almoſt inſupportable, but to have but one of either is not nigh ſo much, for one eye will ſee as much almoſt as both, except in ſome caſes, and the left hand will come to be as uſefull as the right, and one may indifferently well ſhift with one hand. 11. If you ſhall ſay, How ſhall one know that ones right eye offends one? Doth not one look on a woman with both eyes and equally? The anſwer appears in the tenth obſervation.</p>

In this verſe, <hi>It hath been ſaid,</hi> not you <hi>heard it hath been ſaid,</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> and <hi>you have heard it hath been ſaid;</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 43.

                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce]</hi> 1. As I have ſaid, <hi>It is not a man ſhall put away,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away,</hi> or <hi>if one ſhall,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The reaſon why he was to give here a bill of divorce, was that ſhe might not be puniſhed as an adultereſſe, if ſhe married another man; for by the bill of divorce the husband gave free power to the woman to marry whom ſhe would; This was the form, <hi>I have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned freely, uncompelled by any, to diſmiſſe, divorce and forſake thee, who hitherto haſt been my wife, therefore I do diſmiſſe, forſake, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and put thee away from me, that you may be at your own power, and that you may go whither ſoever you pleaſe; neither hath any one at any time forbidden me thus to do, and be thou therefore ſo diſmiſsed, that it ſhall be lawfull for thee to marry whom thou pleaſeſt.</hi> The reaſon why God permitted the Jews to be thus divorced from their wives, was for the hardneſſe of their hearts, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. for elſe they would ſome way or other have made them away: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void murder, God permitted divorce: If you ſhall ask, Why might not a man put away his wife by word of mouth as well as by writing? I anſwer, 1. A writing was a more continuing and ready proof of her divorce then words, for they muſt be proved by witneſſe, who alſo might in a ſhort time die, and ſo the woman might come to be accuſed and put to death for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, for knowing another man. 2. To take away as much as might be the frequency and number of divorces, for writing is a more delibarate act, and requires more time to conſider before he did it, in which time he might haply change his minde, and his anger might be appeaſed, for if the Heathens adviſe to ſay over the Alphabet, before one did any thing in ones anger, ſurely to write over more then ſo many letters as are in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet might be thought a more likely time for ones diſpleaſure to be laid, eſpecially this was a better way for the compoſing ſtrifes, if they did not write their bils of divorce themſelves, but had them written by the Scribes, and ſo required longer time, and the Scribes did, or might often mediate for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; moreover it being a publick act, one would be aſhamed to divorce.</p>

                     <hi>But I ſay unto you]</hi> 1. Before our bleſſed Saviour ſhewed in one caſe, to wit, of adulterous deſires, one might be guilty of adultery; now he ſhews how that the very act of adultery was by them accounted lawfull, which was an adulterous marriage. 2. Chriſt doth here take away the wicked uſe of the permiſſion of divorce, and that which fomented thoſe unlawfull deſires he ſpoke againſt before, for the great abuſe they made of that Law was this, If a man deſired another mans wife, becauſe it was a ſinne puniſhed with death, he would take a way as he thought to avoid both ſinne and puniſhment, and would if he could obtain her conſent, perſwade her to carry her ſelf ſo to her husband as might occaſion him to divorce her, and then he would marry her, and enjoy his unlawfull deſires; our Saviour to ſtop the currant of this wickedneſſe, layes the ſinne of adultery upon all three, upon the husband that divorceth, for cauſing, upon the woman and the man that marry for committing of adultery, and ſo that if the conſcience of the ſinne do touch any of the three, that wicked plot of getting another mans wife, might be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter alſo he takes order for thoſe who would that they might be free to marry another upon ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, divorcee their wives, by ſhewing that he that did ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery.</p>

                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife except for fornication]</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haply be proved by this verſe that one may put away ones wife for fornication or adultery, for all that can be proved, is, that he that doth, doth not cauſe her to commit adultery. 2. See how milde our Saviour is for fornication, before <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.21. ſhe was to be put to death, for adultery after marriage our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth intimate, that ſhe ſhould only be put away. 3. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is here named not adultery, for that may be concluded <hi>à fortiori;</hi> if one may put away ones wife for being falſe before, much more for being ſo after marriage. 4. If you ſhall ſay, Why not for blaſphemy, hereſie, or ſome other notorious ſinne, which are worſe then adultery? I anſwer, It is not the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of adultery, but the nature of the ſinne that makes that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119918:55"/>a juſt cauſe of divorce, and not the other, for that ſinne unties the very knot of Matrimony, and the other doth not.</p>

This inſtance being of a matter which concerned neither the judicial nor the ceremonial Law, which were not from the beginning, but from <hi>Moſes</hi> time; our Savour ſaith that the very Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees told them that this of perjury was a Law in the time of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but thou ſhalt]</hi> 1. There is no one place of Scripture that hath theſe very words, the neareſt <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. nor doth our Saviour ſay, that <hi>it is thus written.</hi> 2. Two kindes of oaths there are, Aſſertory and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory; in the firſt, one then forſwears ones ſelf, when one ſwears a thing that is falſe, though one think it to be true, if one ſwears poſitively, that it is ſo, for one ought not to ſwear, but what one knows to be true. 2. One forſwears ones ſelf, where one ſwears that which one thinks to be falſe, though it be true. 3. Therefore he doth in the higheſt degree and manner forſwear himſelf, that ſwears that which he knows to be falſe. 2. There are Promiſſory Oaths, and then a man forſwears himſelf, when he ſwears to do that which he knows he cannot, or that which he will not do, which he doth not intend to do when he ſwears, or what afterwards he will not do when he comes to perform what he promiſed with an Oath; this is one difference that in the Aſſertory oath, if he be not forſworn when he takes the Oath, he cannot be afterwards forſworn, but in a Promiſtory Oath, if when he ſwears, he knows he can, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119918:55"/>intends to perform, he at that time forſwears not himſelf, yet if afterwards when he comes to perform his promiſe, and doth not, he then become perjured. 3. <hi>But thou ſhalt,</hi> &amp;c. by this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond clauſe it ſeems to reſtrain the words to be meant of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory Oath, for aſſertory Oaths are not to be performed. 4. It doth not neceſſarily reſtrain it to vows, though it be ſaid that one ought to perform ones Oath to God, as if the former words were to be meant onely of ſuch Oaths that one made to God, for even thoſe promiſes that we make to men, if we binde them with an Oath, one may be ſaid to perform them to God, for by an Oath one bindes ones ſelf to God to perform what one promiſeth to men, and therefore it is not ſaid, Perform thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe but thine Oath to God; for the promiſe bindes one, and one performs thoſe to men, but the Oath bindes one, and one performs that to God, as if one be bound to any Court to pay money to Orphans when they come of age, though then one payes the moneys to the Orphans not the Court, yet one may be ſaid to perform ones Bond to the Court; by thine oath thou art bound to God to perform thy promiſe to men. 4. This may be a reſtraint to the former words, as thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt not, &amp;c.</hi> If thou makeſt a promiſe, and takeſt an oath to perform it, thou muſt perform it, if it be ſuch an oath as is not contrary to Gods Law; but ſuch as may be performed to God as well as to men. 5. The largeſt ſenſe of theſe words, is as if the Scribes and Phariſees only thought that perjury, and that in ones vows one made to God (for ſo the place in <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. ſpeaks onely of ſuch) was forbidden, but for aſſertory and promiſtory oaths to man, the matter was not great, whether one forſwear ones ſelf, though this ſeems to be too large a ſenſe, and larger then the Scribes ever taught; the next is that to forſwear was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but not to ſwear: Or laſtly, that forſwearing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were forbidden, but neither, eſpecially this later, except one did ſwear by God, indeed one doth not reade expreſly, that ſwearing by any but God, or falſe god is forbibben in the Old Teſtament; that place that doth forbid it moſt clearly is <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.20. and indeed it doth fully prove, that one ſhould not ſwear by the creature; for the reaſon brought is, becauſe he is thy praiſe and thy God: ſo then one ought not to ſwear by that which is not ones praiſe, and ones God, that they held it unlawfull to ſwear by the gold of the Temple, and the gift upon the Altar, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.18. was for a particular reaſon, as may appear in his proper place; as if they ſhould ſay, when you ſwear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119918:56"/>by God, then you are bound to perform your oaths, for the oaths that are not by God, that is in which the name of God is not mentioned, or ſome way included, doubtleſſe by vertue of that oath one is not bound to God to perform ones promiſes or ones oath (for one is bound by ones oath to him by whom one ſwears) and ſo by conſequence one could not perform ones oath to God, except one ſwear by his name, and prophaned not that, though one ſwore by the creature, by heaven or earth, or the Temple, or the Altar, it was nothing, for they did not hold that by ſwearing by heaven one ſware by him that ſits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.22.</p>

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.23. 1 Cor. 9.22. Or, 2.

At all therefore is to have a reſtriction. 2. From theſe inſtances which are all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of oaths by the creature, the third limitation of at all is from the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe in your common diſcourſe, in your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <hi>Neither by Heaven]</hi> 1. Theſe four forms of oaths are inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, becauſe they were the commoneſt oaths then among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> for <hi>by the head</hi> was of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though <hi>by their Jupiter</hi> was more common; but our Saviour did not ſpeak againſt that, for the Law was ſo plain in that, that the Scribes themſelves taught, that to ſwear by falſe gods was a ſin, and our Saviours intent is here to ſhew how that the righteouſneſſe which the Scribes taught, nor the Phariſees practiſed, would bring one to heaven, as you have it <hi>ver.</hi> 20. this not to have place in promiſſory oaths, for neither are we ſure that we ſhall perform them, or we may otherwiſe oblige our ſelves by bond or Covenant, and oaths are not to be uſed but when no other way will ſerve; but in aſſertory oaths there is no other waies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times to evidence a thing, for aſſertory oaths atteſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we know, that we know it to be true, and none knows the things of the ſpirit of a man, but the ſpirit of man, and he to whom he will reveal it; but promiſſory oaths being of matter of fact, that conſidering it is of a future thing, to be done for the good of another, will certainly be known whether we do it or no. 2. In the Greek it is in heaven, and it is an Hebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, for they when they ſwear uſe <hi>in,</hi> the Latine and our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh by; the Greek a particle proper to that, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 3. For the order of the inſtances they are haply according to the order of the excellency of the things that are ſworn by, heaven, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more excellent then earth, and ſo of the reſt. You will ſay, ſince we allow to ſwear by God is lawful, and our Saviour ſaith that whoſoever ſwears by heaven, ſweareth by God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.22. therefore it is lawfull to ſwear by heaven. I anſwer, If to ſwear by heaven be a ſin, then to ſwear by heaven, though in ſwearing by it one ſwears by God, is a ſin; which appears thus, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.22. ſo then, he ſwears both by heaven and by God. It being ſuppoſed therefore that to ſwear by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a ſin, he that ſwears by heaven (though he intends by that oath to ſwear by God) ſins, ſince he ſwears by heaven, and by God; and doubtleſſe the joyning of a good or lawfull with an unlawfull, takes not away the obliquity of the unlawfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 2. Since to ſwear by God, is a part of Divine Worſhip, to ſwear by a creature <hi>terminativè,</hi> or to ſwear by God in a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are both idolatrous; by this you may take one obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the way, that as whoſoever ſwears by God in a creature, ſwears by both, ſo whoſoever worſhips God in a creature, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips both; ſo then to bow to a Crucifix in reference to Chriſt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119918:57"/>is to bow to the Crucifix and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For it is the throne of God]</hi> 1. For the words taken in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without relation to the former words, take them as a truth not as a reaſon, then they ſhew the excellency of heaven, that the Majeſty and Glory of God is ſeen there fully. 2. That it is higher, and larger, and richer then the earth, for ſo is the Throne in reſpect of the footſtool. 2. The glory and immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of God, who hath ſo large and ſo rich a Throne. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that our Saviour in the three firſt inſtances uſeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture concerning them, to ſhow us that in all our words concerning Divine matters, the beſt way is to ſpeak the language of the Scripture. 2. As a reaſon it thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, firſt, That what ſhall be ſaid may more clearly appear, you are to know, that whenſoever one ſwears by any thing, it is by way of atteſtation, or by way of oppignoration; the firſt way we call that to witneſſe by which we ſwear, and do impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his puniſhment if we ſwear falſly: in the other we do as it were lay the thing to pawn by which we ſwear, and it differs from the other chiefly in this, that we limit Gods puniſhment, and do as it were give ſuch a thing to be done with as he ſhall think fit, if we ſpeak not true; we do as it were wiſh that ſuch a thing may be deſtroyed, if what we ſay be not true; and the ſaying of S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſeems true in this, that <hi>id per quod home ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, vol veneratur, vel diligit,</hi> either ſomething that is ſacred or dear to us. Three reaſons there are why one ſhould not ſwear neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1. Since who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſwears by heaven, ſwears by the Throne of God, and by him that ſits thereon, as you may ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.22. and ſo ſince your Law ſayes, that to ſwear by God falſly or vainly, is a ſin, therefore to ſwear by heaven is a ſin; he that ſwears by the earth, ſwears by him that treads thereon; and if by <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> by him that dwels therein, and ſo by God, and ſo unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ordinary communication, and without urgent neceſſity, for then it is in vain. 2. Or if you ſay you do not bring nor call God, that ſits, or treads, or dwels in thoſe places, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or earth, or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to witneſſe and revenge, then you make them to be able to know the thoughts of your hearts, and to puniſh, and ſo you make them which are creatures, God. 3. If you do ſwear by theſe by way of oppignoration, then the reaſon ſtands firm, neither the heavens, nor the earth, nor <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> are yours to pawn, for they all are God's, the one is his Throne, the other his Footſtool, and the other his City,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119918:57"/>and none ought to pawn what is not his own; ſo alſo of your head, it may be ſaid of ſwearing by your head, for if you bring it by way of atteſtation, to teſtifie and revenge, though it may know the truth, yet it will not revenge, for it cannot, for it cannot do things far leſſe, not make one hair white or black; and if you pawn it, then (in which ſenſe I ſuppoſe here it is meant, for when we ſwear by ones head, I ſuppoſe it is onely by way of oppignoration, for ſometimes we in expreſſe tearms ſay, I'le pawn my life on it) then the reaſon of our Saviour ſtands exceeding firm, for it is as if he ſhould ſay, you ſwear by your head, and you will lay that to pawn, as if you had <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dominium</hi> over that, to do with, or diſpoſe of it as you pleaſe; yours, your head is none of yours, for you cannot alter the property, no not the colour of one hair, you have not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over one poor hair, not onely not to make it grow, but not of altering the colour of it; therefore if you cannot diſpoſe of one hair, much leſſe of the whole head: Or thus, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make one hair grow black or white, therefore much leſſe an hair to grow, much leſſe all the hairs, much leſſe the head, and all the integral parts of it; therefore if your head be the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of another, then you are not the Lord of that which you call your head, for every one is the Lord of his own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and as before I ſaid, it is an unjuſt thing to wiſh a curſe upon that which is anothers, if we ſay falſe, for then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhould be puniſhed for our fault, and for our perjury; that we are puniſhed too, takes not off the injuſtice; or as ſome would have it, though I allow not of it, this is to be referred to all as a general reaſon, why one ſhould not ſwear by any thing at all, either God or the creatures, that we will do ſuch or ſuch a thing, for of promiſſory oaths apparently here it is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the reaſon ſtands thus, If you have not ſo much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as to make one hair white or black, then thou haſt power to do little or nothing, why therefore ſhouldſt thou ſwear to do what thou canſt not do?</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119918:58"/>or diſcourſe oaths are not lawfull. 2. There may be ſomething in that word, <hi>your,</hi> that a Chriſtian ought to be of ſuch veracity, that their yea or nay ought to be as ſtrong an affirmation as others oaths, and they ought as much to abhor a lye as others do perjury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, yea: nay, nay]</hi> 1. To give a reaſon why yea, yea, in the order ſhould be before nay, nay, I ſuppoſe 1. Would rather be curious then edifying, as to ſay, that affirmation in nature is before negation, or that one ſhould if one could, rather geant what is requeſted, then deny; but it could hardly be thought the intention of our Saviour in theſe words, to intimate that duty to us in the order of the words. 2. But for the iteration of both words there may be ſaid ſomething more pertinent. 1. It may be to ſhew that we may uſe ſtrong aſſeverations, though we may not ſwear, for by doubling of it, ones aſſeveration grows ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 2. To ſhew that he that requires a promiſe, or ones wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any thing, ſhould propoſe it without an oath, as well as the other that promiſeth or teſtifies ſhould not do either by way of an oath; for as among the <hi>Romaus</hi> their way of ſtipulation was not by way of an oath, but by repeating the ſame word that was propoſed to them, to wit, <hi>facies, faciam, dabis, dabo,</hi> ſo theſe in all their bargains and promiſes ſhould be, yea, yea: nay, nay. 3. That their yea in word ſhould be yea in deed, they ſhould ſpeak what was true, and the yea of their mouth ſhould be yea of their heart, they ſhould ſpeak what they think, and the yea of their mouth ſhould be the yea of their work, that they ſhould perform what they promiſe, in one or all which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> 5.12. may be taken, and thought to intend, when he ſaith, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay.</hi> 3. Or may the meaning be, that Chriſtians ought not to be crafty and double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing, nor cunning, but ſpeak openly and plainly, and not to uſe equivocations?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of evil]</hi> 1. Not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more, that is, whatſoever words we uſe more in our communication, as if we ought to ſpeak no more then may ſerve to anſwer the Queſtions which are asked us, but our aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought not to be expreſſed with oaths, but onely in theſe words, or ſome equivalent to them. 2. <hi>Is more then theſe,</hi> the word properly ſignifies excellent; ſo then ſince all proteſtations, oaths, execrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do exceed or excell a bare aſſeveration, they are here forbidden. 3. <hi>Cometh,</hi> the Greek is, <hi>Is of evil,</hi> but the ſenſe is well expreſſed by <hi>cometh,</hi> for the ſenſe is, that it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119918:58"/>proceeds from evil that we uſe more words, whether they be oaths, or ſtronger aſſeverations then yea or nay. 4. The words are not, that to uſe more as in any caſe to ſwear is evil, but <hi>cometh of evil.</hi> 5. It may be ſaid <hi>to come of evil</hi> two wayes, 1. From the evil one, from the devil, for ſo he is often called in the Scripture, and it may be ſaid to come from him, becauſe he tempts one to the ſinne of ſwearing, or becauſe he it was that tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo being the cauſe of his ſinne, and his ſinne being the cauſe of ours. 2. Or the ſenſe may be, that all oaths, and vehement proteſtations either proceed from our raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if we may be believed without them, for then they are vain; or they are cauſed by the incredulity of thoſe to whom we make them, and their want of charity, if they ſuſpect our vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city unjuſtly; or from evil in us if we have given them juſt cauſe to diſtruſt us, or from evil, that is, it comes from the general falſhood of men; for as he that is a liar is not believed when he tels the truth, ſo there being ſo many deceitfull men, makes that honeſt men are not believed. 6. It is not ſaid, that whatſoever other expreſſion, but whatſoever ſtronger aſſeveration, for ſo the words as I have ſhewed ſignifies, for we may uſe any other word that is not a ſtronger aſſeveration, as the <hi>Romans</hi> in their ſtipulations might uſe their <hi>dabo,</hi> or <hi>faciam,</hi> as innocently as to ſay yea.</p>

It is not ſaid, that it was ſaid of old, for this being part of the judicial Law, and not of the moral Law, it was not <hi>ſaid of old,</hi> for that an offence ſhould be puniſhed is not moral, for then one ſhould ſinne, if one ſhould forgive it, much leſſe is it moral, that ſuch a kinde, or ſo much puniſhment ſhould be inflicted, for ſome Nations a leſſe puniſhment will deterre, and ſome a puniſhment in their fame, ſome a gracefull puniſhment, ſome others mulcts and fines, and puniſhments generally are either for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the party offended, or for the amendment of the party offending, which alters according to the ſeveral conditions of men. 2. If any one ſhould ask, whether we are bound to have that Law in force, that before would ſatisfie? 3. The reaſon why the Law inſtanceth in an eye and a tooth, is becauſe thoſe are the parts of the body which are moſt commonly loſt in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119918:59"/>4. This Law had not hold if a maſter ſhould ſtrike out the eye or tooth of his ſervant, but in ſtead of it he was to be ſet free. 5. The falſe gloſſes that are ſuppoſed, that the Scribes by their doctrine, and the Phariſees by their practice did put upon the Law, were, either that they thought that if they did take revenge themſelves, ſo it did not exceed that which the Law ſet down, <hi>An eye for an eye,</hi> it was lawfull, which ſeems to be the meaning of our Saviours words following, <hi>Reſiſt not evil, Do not you your ſelves take vengeance;</hi> and indeed the reaſon of Gods enjoyning and appointing Magiſtrates to puniſh, and not giving every man leave to revenge his own quarrel, are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, for the hindering injuſtice yea and revenge alſo; for firſt if one ſhould have power to be judge in ones own cauſe, one ſhould be partial and revenge too much. 2. The revenge one hath legally, one hath time to deliberate, for it cannot be ſo ſpeedily had, as if one ſhould do ones ſelf juſtice upon the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the injury. 2. And it is ſome trouble and charges to proſecute, and then it is a queſtion, Whether one ſhall have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo that either when one hath time for ones anger to cool, one ſhall not deſire, or if one doth deſire, either the trouble or charges, or uncertainty of prevailing, or all may deterre one from ſeeking revenge, none of which, or not all, or in not ſo high a degree, do happen in private revenge. 2. Or that if the Magiſtrate would, or did not do them juſtice, that then they might take it themſelves. 3. Or which ſeems the main errour of theirs, that our Saviour here ſpeaks againſt, they thought it no ſinne at all in them, to urge and take the full penalty of the Law for any injury that was offered them.</p>

Though doubtleſſe one may flee from, and defend ones ſelf from evil, ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119918:59"/>one doth not offend others; for our Saviour bids us, and he himſelf and the Apoſtles did flee from one City to another when they were perſecuted. 3. Nor as farre as I can underſtand doth this prove warre to be unlawfull; for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt when the ſouldiers came to him, did not forbid them their profeſſion, nor any of the Centurions that were converted left their callings, and divers Chriſtians in the primitive Church were ſouldiers; and <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he was the meekeſt man in ſuffering any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, yet for the defence of another he ſlew the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> Heb. 11.34.

                     <hi>And if any will ſue thee at the Law,</hi> &amp;c.] Now our Saviour comes to ſpeak of thoſe injuries that were done under pretence of Law: For, 2. There is ſome difference between <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.29. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of an outward violence, and <hi>Matthew</hi> of a legal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, therefore the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> are tranſpoſed in <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe in outward violence the firſt thing that we are ſpoiled off is our garment. 3. The words that we tranſlate <hi>Coat,</hi> is in the original <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſignifies that inner linen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we wear next our fleſh. This is alſo, as I ſuppoſe, that which our Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is taken for any upper garment. So that two things may be intimated, 1. Which is the main, That it is better to ſuffer a ſecond greater injury then to revenge a ſmall one, which ariſeth from this conſideration, that the inward generally is of farre leſſe value then the outward garment. 2. That though ſutes of Law divers times begin upon ſmall matters, yet they ſeldom end there. 3. It is not ſaid, that we ſhould give our other garment to him that takes away one, neither in <hi>Luke</hi> nor in <hi>Matthew;</hi> may it not be to ſhew, that in ſuch kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries we are only to be paſſive? 4. For the <hi>Socinians</hi> making theſe advices of our Saviour to be the higheſt pieces of prudence. And upon that account our Saviour does adviſe them; certainly though in moſt caſes it is the greateſt part of prudence to ſuffer much loſſe rather then go to Law; yet whoſoever ſhall obey this command upon account of prudence, only there being ſo much of ſelf in ſo doing, that we cannot honour it with the name of Chriſtian obedience, as alſo becauſe in ſo doing he honours Chriſt no more then any one would honour Mahomet, ſince whoſoever ſhall give us ſuch counſel as we do judge the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, we follow the counſel, though the perſon be never ſo wicked. 5. It may not be from hence proved that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull in all reſpects to go to Law: For, 1. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119918:60"/>blames the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for going to Law, he does not blame them ſimply for going to Law, but for going to Law before the Heathens, and gives them leave to do the ſame thing amongſt themſelves, if not by legal eſtabliſhing of Judges to hear and determine cauſes amongſt Chriſtians, yet by a mutual and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary choice of perſons to whom they would referre the matter in difference, and there is no difference between a conſtituted Judge and an Arbitrator, ſave only this, that an Arbitrator is a Judge of our own choice, and a Judge is an Arbitrator choſen without our conſent by another, and therefore as one may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put things to arbitration; ſo one may alſo when he is not able to determine to whom the right of ſuch lands or goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, put it to the Judge to tell us who hath right in Law to them; and indeed all going to Law is unlawfull on one ſide or other, except it be in caſe of ignorance to whom the thing ſued for belongs; for if the Plaintiff knows that that is not his right he ſues for or the Defendant that it is the Plaintiffs right, the one ſins in commencing, the other in ſtanding out the ſute. The next argument to prove that going to Law is lawful, is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.8. But if you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay, If one be accuſed of ſedition, or any criminal cauſe, it is lawful to defend ones ſelf, which may be one of the ſenſes of that of the Apoſtle, <hi>That we ſhould not ſuffer as evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> for <hi>a good name is as precious ointment,</hi> and we ought in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to religion, and our brethren in meekneſſe clear our ſelves from any crime that we are charged withall, and theſe were the ſutes that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood out in. <hi>Reſp.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are ſued for money or any thing of that nature which is not criminal; May we not ſay that in ſome ſenſe our good name lies at the ſtake, ſince the very ſuing of us does ſuppoſe that we keep ſomething which is not our own? nay his very deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding though we ſtand out the ſute layes the ſame aſperſion in ſome meaſure upon us. 1. The rules for going to Law are theſe, 1. That it muſt be our laſt refuge after all other means have been tried and avail not. 2. We ſhould not ſue for any thing which we in our conſcience think not to be ours. 3. We ſhould not go to Law for trivial matters. 4. We ſhould not uſe any unjuſt wayes, as of bribery, falſe witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we might prevail in our ſutes. 5. We muſt bear no malice to him whom we ſue for, in ſo doing while we demand of him what is ours we take from him that which is his, <hi>viz.</hi> love, which we owe unto all men. 6. We ought not to be impatient though
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119918:61"/>never ſo unjuſtly ſued, for in this caſe we muſt do as <hi>Job</hi> did, though all his goods were taken from him, yet he held his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, ſo it is curſorily better, that if one be ſued at Law for his Coat he give his Cloke alſo, then to part with his patience; in being out of patience, one is out of poſſeſſion of his own ſoul, for in patience it is that we poſſeſſe our ſoul, as we ought not to uſe any unneceſſary delayes to increaſe the charge, and trouble the ſute.</p>

                     <hi>Give to him that asketh]</hi> Firſt, There is a difference betwixt this and the other inſtances of our Saviour; in the other, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commands us to be ready to ſuffer twice as much as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly is laid upon us, but here he ſets down, not what we muſt give, but that we muſt give, much leſſe does he require that we ſhould give twice as much as is asked, for it is not ſaid to him that asks a peny give two.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not ſaid, what we muſt give, 1. Becauſe there can be no general rule given for any particular ſumme or thing, ſince the neceſſities of them that ask, and the abilities of him that gives are various. Or, 2. May it not be becauſe the meaning of the Text may be this, that we ſhould give as well that which is asked, as to him that asks? 3. Or is it not becauſe though we are not bound to give what he asks, if we are not able, yet we are bound to give what we can, and all may give ſomething, at leaſt ſpeeches of compaſſion and comfort? Or, 4. Becauſe ſometimes we are bound to give more then he asks, for if his wants appear to be very great, the modeſty of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119918:61"/>his requeſts ſhould not hinder the liberality of our beneficence. 5. Nor is it ſaid, that we ſhould give him what he asks, but that we muſt give, for one may ask as well what we may not, as what we cannot give, yet then we muſt give him counſel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſuppoſe it is not meant that one ſhould not give except they be asked, yet this haply may be ſaid, that if thorow pride and ſtoutneſſe one ſcorns to ask, one though he know he needs, yet is not bound to give; for if one that thorow idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will not labour, ſhould not eat, there is as much equity, that he that thorow pride will not ask, ſhould not eat.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To him that asks,</hi> that is, to all that asks, for ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 6.30. it is; it is not meant that we ſhould give to all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, but without partiality, for there are rules ſet down by the holy Ghoſt, for our not giving to ſome, 1.

                     <hi>His Sun to ariſe]</hi> 1. <hi>A fortiori</hi> is a motive to us to do good to our enemies, 1.

Conſider what he gives, it is his Sun, the greateſt of all temporal bleſſings in the world, for we might longer live without food or raiment, then without the benefit of the Sun, for without his heat all things that are would immediately freeze; nay not onely by giving the wicked the benefit of the Sun they enjoy that heat which is neceſſary for life, but they enjoy the light of the Sun, which is a thing of ornament and pleaſure to make their life comfortable, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.7. therefore if God gives the wicked, things of ornament, much more give your enemy bread, <hi>&amp;c.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the good and the bad]</hi> 1. Some may ſay, How can it be otherwiſe, for if the Sun ſhines upon the good, how can it but ſhine upon the bad alſo, ſince they are in one Kingdom, in one Town, in one houſe? But God is not neceſſitated to beſtow this mercy upon the bad, though he beſtows it upon the good, for <hi>de facto,</hi> God did make it dark in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when it was light for three dayes in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> though they were of the ſame Kingdome, and ſo the cloud gave light to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their march, and at the ſame time was darkneſſe to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 14.19, 20. Beſides God can ſtrike all wicked men with blindeneſſe, ſo that the Sunne ſhall be in reſpect of its light, as if it was not to them, and he might ſtrike them with ſuch a burning feaver, as he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.22. that for its heat the Sunne ſhould be worſe to them, then if it was not, and thouſand other wayes known to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee that by common and temporal bleſſings the good are not diſtinguiſhed from the bad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It follows that wicked and unjuſt men are Gods enemies, and curſe God, and hate God, and perſecute God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe him, or elſe it would not follow from this example of Gods dealing with wicked men, that we <hi>ſhould love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c. for one might ſay, it is true, God makes his Sunne to ſhine upon the bad and unjuſt, but they though they are Gods
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119918:64"/>enemies, do not hate him, curſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as mine do me.</p>

                     <hi>And he ſendeth rain]</hi> 1. God beſtows not only one but many bleſſings upon the wicked, he doth not only make the Sunne to ariſe, but ſends alſo the rain upon them, nay by beſtowing this ſecond bleſſing, he takes off that inconvenience that otherwiſe would follow upon the enjoyment of the firſt, nay they do help mutually one another, for the rain cools the heat of the Sunne, and the Sunne warms the coolneſſe of the rain, and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the earth fruitful; from hence we may learn, 1. To do great and many benefits to our enemies. 2. Not to do them ſuch courteſies that we know will bring miſchiefs on them, and to do them good in one thing, on purpoſe to do them hurt in another. 3. We ſhould do good to thoſe that do not onely not thank us for courteſies, but attribute it to others, for God does ſo, <hi>He makes his Sunne to ſhine and his rain to fall,</hi> not onely upon thoſe that are ſo bad as not to be thankfull for them, but are ſo exceeding unjuſt as not to account God the authour of them. The obſervations concerning Gods making the Sunne to ariſe, &amp;c. <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> may agree to this latter part of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon the juſt and unjuſt]</hi> 1. It is not ſet down here as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed, as if there were ſome bad that were not unjuſt, and ſo unjuſt that were not bad, nor is it to be meant, God makes his Sunne to ariſe on the bad, and ſends his rain upon the unjuſt, beſtows ſome kinde of theſe bleſſings upon ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the other kinde upon other wicked men, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows both upon all, as before it is not meant, We ſhould love our enemies, but not love thoſe that curſed us, or bleſſe thoſe that curſed us, but not bleſſe thoſe that hate us; but as when God commands us to bleſſe them that curſe us, and does not ſay, <hi>Do good to them that curſe you;</hi> it is becauſe bleſſing is directly oppoſed to curſing, and ſo it is more likely to make him that curſes ſee his errour, becauſe contraries being placed one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make each other more apparent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is a more direct way, ſo it is a more milde ſweet way; for as when one pronounceth a word of Latine wrong, it is a better way to take ſome way immediately to pronounce it right, and ſo ſhew him his errour, then to call him an ignorant man, and ſo ſhew it him: So it is a ſweeter way when a man does as it were pronounce his words falſly by railing againſt one,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119918:64"/>by bleſſing of him, to ſhew him how to pronounce them right, then by bitter invectives to tell him of his wickedneſſe: So God is ſaid to rain upon the unjuſt rather then upon the bad, becauſe that the unjuſt by racking of rents, with-holding of corn and other ſuch like oppreſſions of the poor, do abuſe the fruits of the earth, ſo that God by bleſſing of him in thoſe very things wherein he doth as it were curſe God, and by being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to him in thoſe things wherein he is ſo niggardly to the poor doth ſhew him his errour, by doing that very thing right which he did wrong.</p>

                     <hi>Beye therefore perfect,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. It is not meant as if it was poſſible to be as perfect as God is, and therefore it is not ſaid, Be as perfect as your Father which is in heaven, but be ye perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect; noting to us, that we muſt have the kindes not the ſame degrees of perfection, yet there is one exception to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> that we muſt ſtrive for all thoſe kindes of perfection that are communicable to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for when a Father bids his childe be like him, he does not mean, that his childe ſhould be his Father, ſo when we are commanded to be like God, it is meant in ſuch properties that we may have and ſtill continue creatures; and ſuch perfections though we ſtrove to attain, yet God was in no wiſe hindred
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119918:65"/>from having them alſo: as for example, if we ſhould endeavour to have our own wils done in all things, Gods will could not be done in all things, except our will was ſo ſanctified, that our will was to do Gods will in all things, and then we did it not as our own will, but as his; ſo if we ſhould do all things for our own glory, without reference to Gods glory, we ſhould do ſome things wherein God ſhould be diſhonoured, but in other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as in this which is ſpoken of in the Text, our loving our enemies, our doing good to all, forgiving of injuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not hinder God from doing good to his enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is rather one act of his love towards them, that he would have us to love them alſo, for we ought to love their perſons though not their vices, and we ought to love them though they be Gods enemies, though we ought not to love them as they are, that is, becauſe they are Gods enemies: ſo our being holy hinders not Gods being holy, nor <hi>è contra</hi> in theſe communicable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes did the likeneſſe of <hi>Adam</hi> to God conſiſt, which he loſt by deſiring to be like unto God in his incommunicable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which deſire we are to mortifie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To be perfect as God is perfect,</hi> is to inſtance in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, 1. To come as near to that degree of love that God bears to his enemies, as we can. 2. To have our love as extenſive as Gods love is, and that in two reſpects: 1. In reſpect of the object, and that in reſpect either of the kinde, or of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether they be never ſo much, or never ſo many wayes, or never ſo long our enemies, that for the kinde, and we are to love not only ſome of every kinde, but every particular perſon of every kinde, <hi>Singula generum, &amp; genera ſingulorum.</hi> 2. Extenſive in reſpect of the act, and that three wayes, 1. You muſt do much good to your enemies. 2. You muſt do many good turns to your enemies. 3. You muſt do many kindes of good to your enemies: As 1. God makes his Sunne to ſhine upon his enemies. 2. He makes it daily to ariſe upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 3. He makes his rain to fall as well as the Sunne to ariſe, that is, God beſtows many kindes of bleſſings. 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, in reſpect of duration we ought not to be weary of well-doing unto them; as God not onely made the Sun to ariſe in our Saviours time upon his enemies, but alſo ſtill continues to do ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. We ought not to imitate them in all things, ſince they do many things amiſſe, and then it is a curſe to follow them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Secondly, Here are arguments why we ſhould imitate God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take heed that ye]</hi> 1. We ought not only to take heed what we do, <hi>Do not your alms,</hi> but how we do that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhews that we are very ſubject to erre in the manner and end of our works, be our works never ſo good, or elſe we need not be adviſed to take ſuch great heed, and indeed the people of God do generally abſtain from thoſe actions that are materially evil, but there is not one action whatſoever through their whole life, but either in reſpect of the ground, manner or end, they more or leſſe offend.

                  <p n="3">3. The word tranſlated <hi>Alms</hi> ſignifies pity and compaſſion, which ſhews that all our alms that we give to the poor ſhould proceed from our pity and compaſſion we bear to them, not out of expectation of praiſe that we deſire to our ſelves.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119918:67"/>may be ſeen of men, then in the beſtowing of our own, becauſe there is little danger of vain-glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not ſaid, <hi>Your alms,</hi> as if we were not bound by Gods Law to give them, or as if the poor had not a religious ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to them, but it is haply to ſhew that we ſhould give alms of ſuch things that none had any civil right to, but our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is ſaid <hi>Your alms,</hi> to ſhew that we do not loſe thoſe goods that we give to the poor, but that they ſtill are as much, nay more ours, then if we kept them in our own poſſeſſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>They are but lent to the Lord,</hi> though they are given to the poor, and he that lends loſes not his title to that that he lends.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We are to do our alms: to ſay as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Be ye cloathed, and be ye fed,</hi> is wiſhing not doing of alms; therefore it is not here ſaid, <hi>Have ye compaſſion,</hi> as the word we tranſlate <hi>Alms</hi> ſignifies, but the inward pity muſt ſhew it ſelf in outward actions if we be able.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is not ſaid, <hi>Take heed ye give not your alms to be ſeen of men,</hi> but, <hi>Do not your alms to be ſeen of men,</hi> for indeed though the alms be done, yet if they be done for that end the alms are not given, but they are ſold for the vain applauſe of men.</p>

If ye ſhall ſay, We have no reward of our Father now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but ſhall have hereafter: To that may be anſwered, That all the rewards that any of Gods people ſhall have for any good work, though it be not preſently beſtowed upon them, and in their poſſeſſion, yet they are prepared for them, and in Gods poſſeſſion; the rewards you ſhall have are with your Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, if therefore you have no reward with your Father now, you ſhall never have any reward with your Father hereafter, for the word that we tranſlate <hi>of,</hi> is evidently in the Greek <hi>with,</hi> as ye may ſee in our margent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not ſaid, Ye have no great reward, but no reward at all, for ſuch a by-end, as I ſaid, does not make an end leſſe good, but wholly evil.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though it be ſaid only, <hi>Ye have no reward,</hi> yet it is meant, Ye ſhall be puniſhed, it being a frequent Hebraiſm by a milder expreſſion to ſet down the juſtice of God; and the reaſon why our Saviour does not here ſet it down in thoſe terms, Ye ſhall be caſt into hell fire, may be, 1. This being one of his firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and as is ſuppoſed the firſt that he preached to any ſo great a Congregation, it is to ſhew that we ought to try whether people will be won with milder before we uſe harſher expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Or is it not to ſhew to abſtain from ſinne for fear of the loſſe of heaven, is a perfecter motive, then to abſtain from ſinne for fear of the puniſhments of hell. Or, 3. Doth it not ſhew that in hell the ſenſe of the pains we feel ſhall not ſo torment us as the loſſe of heavenly joyes, and it is as if he ſhould ſay, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell you of the rewards you ſhall loſe, then of the pains of hell, becauſe howſoever for the preſent you ſtand affected, yet you ought to be more affected, and ſhall certainly hereafter be move afflicted with the loſſe of the joyes of heaven if you loſe them, then with the torments of hell, though you feel them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With your Father which is in heaven]</hi> 1. It ſhews the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the rewards of the righteous above the rewards of the world. 1. They are ſafer, for thoſe of the world are with us, and thoſe things that are now in our poſſeſſion when a ſtronger then we are ſhall come, may be taken from us by violence, and when a ſubtler ſhall come, may be taken from us by deceit, or when the good man of the houſe ſhall ſleep, a thief may break thorow and ſteal them; or be he never ſo ſtrong, wiſe and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119918:68"/>watchfull, yet the moth and ruſt may conſume, but the rewards of the righteous are in the poſſeſſion of God, who is Almighty and All-wiſe, and ſo able; and he is your father, and ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keep them for you; and they are in heaven, and ſo in ſuch a place where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where thief cannot break thorow and ſteal. 2. Or is it not to ſhew ſo much what rewards we ſhall have, as with whom we ſhall have, for if we had never ſo great rewards, and yet at that time be deprived of the preſence of God, they could be nothing to us. 1. In truth they could be nothing, for in thy preſence, no full joy out of his preſence. 2. If we love God above all things, they could be nothing to us without we had them with him; that which <hi>Abſolom</hi> in hypocriſie ſaid to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> every poor ſoul doth truly and feelingly ſay to God, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I come from Geſhur? it had been good for me to have been there ſtill, now therefore let me ſee the Kings face,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.32. 2. <hi>With your Father,</hi> doth not imply that God is rewarded when we are rewarded, but it implies theſe two things, 1. That for the preſent it is in his poſſeſſion, and he keeps it for us. And 2. That hereafter it ſhall be in his preſence that we ſhall enjoy it. 3. <hi>We have no reward of the Father,</hi> that implies two things, that thoſe good things that hypocrites enjoy in this world, God doth or may give them by way of common providence, but not by way of reward. And 2. That thoſe things that they have by way of reward for ſuch actions, as praiſe, &amp;c. they have it from men, and not from God. 4. It ſhews that the reward which we have from God is far greater then that which we have from men, and that all the rewards that we have from men, if we have none with God, can bring us no comfort.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sound not a trumpet before thee]</hi> 1. The word in the Syriack ſeems to ſignifie to cauſe to ſound, and the word in the Greek here uſed is to be taken as the words in the firſt conjugation in the Hebrew, and the Seventy in their Tranſlation uſe this word in Hebrew that ſignifies to cauſe to ſound, and ſo it is in the Margent of our Bibles; and it is very probable that every one of thoſe hypocrites were able themſelves to ſound a trumpet, but the word in our Engliſh that we uſe, is taken in both ſenſes. 2. It ſeems it was not the cuſtome among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that poor people ſhould come from door to door a begging, but that at certain places and times a publick ſignal being given, the poor were gathered together, and then what well-diſpoſed people would, or what otherwiſe they had to beſtow, was diſtributed among them, and this was done in the times of publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in the Synagogues, and at other times in the ſtreets, and this cuſtome had theſe conveniences with it, 1. That upon the daies of publick aſſemblies, the Synagogue being the place of the relief of the poor, it cauſed them to come to the publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And, 2. It being howſoever in a publick place where many were gathered together, ſuch poor as were vagrant, lazy or wicked might the eaſier be diſcovered, but in tract of time it came to paſſe that whoſoever deſired publick applauſe of men,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119918:69"/>when he had any alms to give to the poor, he would make uſe of this publick ſignal, on purpoſe that they might take notice of his alms. 3. Chriſt by forbidding us to ſound a trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, forbids all other wayes of publiſhing alms for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men. 4. The uſe of the trumpet among the Jews was three-fold, either, 1. Civil, as for the gathering together the Princes of the people. 2. Military. 3. Religious, as you may ſee it more largely ſet down in <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that the hypocrites uſing the trumpet in this, their uſe of it being neither civil nor religious, it was martial, and that they came rather to give God battel then to give the poor an alms. 5. There was theſe notorious ſigns of their hypocriſie, 1. That they would have men take notice of their liberality to the poor. 2. That they uſed ſuch a publick way to make them known, as by blowing of a trumpet. 3. That they themſelves would be preſent when their liberality was thus made known. 4. That notwithſtanding they did all this for the praiſe of men, yet they would uſe ſuch wayes to get it, that had not a manifeſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their ſeeking vain-glory, becauſe the calling together of the poor by the trumpet, was primarily intended for other ends, as hath been ſaid. 6. This ſhews that thoſe things that have been notoriouſly abuſed by hypocrites and idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except in caſe of neceſſity; or that they are commanded by the Word, though we ſuffer ſome ſmall inconveniences, we ought to forbear the uſe of them, as in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As the hypocrites do]</hi> 1. All hypocrites do ſound before them when they give alms, <hi>i.e.</hi> they either literally do ſo, or by way of analogy, they do their alms after ſuch a manner, or at leaſt to that end that they may be praiſed of men, for the Trinity of the world being profit, pleaſure, and honour, there being no carnal pleaſure, much leſſe temporal profit in giving alms, they muſt needs do it for to be ſeen of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The works that the hypocrites do we are not forbidden, but to do them after that manner, for it is not, which the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do, but <hi>as</hi> the hypocrites do; inſomuch in this particular it is not lawful in all caſes to blow a trumpet when one gives alms, but alwayes unlawful to do after that manner, and to that end as hypocrites do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hypocrites, the word properly ſignifies Stage-players, who perſonate thoſe men, and act thoſe parts of grief, joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in geſtures, cloathes and ſpeech do ſeem to be others, divers times contrary to what they are, men women, and beggars kings.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119918:69"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Saviour does not ſay, Do as the Scribes and Phariſees do, but Do not as the hypocrites do: might it not be, 1. To ſhew us, that we ſhould not ſpeak againſt the perſons, but againſt the vices of men. 2. Or, becauſe it may be there were ſome of the Scribes and Phariſees that were not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Synagogues, and in the ſtreets]</hi> 1. Their Synagogues were built after the manner of their Temple for ſituation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally built upon a hill, and for poſition being built Eaſt and Weſt, and for diſtribution having a place anſwerable to that where they kept the Ark, and alſo a partition in the Synagogue that divided betwixt the place where the men, and where the women ſate: and for officers, as there was the ruler of the high-Prieſt anſwering to the high-Prieſt in the Temple, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the high-Prieſts aſſociate and aſſiſtant, there were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Synagogue; the differences betwixt the Synagogue and the Temple were theſe, 1. In reſpect of number, for there was but one Temple and many Synagogues. 2. In reſpect of Ordinances, they might preach and pray, but they might not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſave only in the Temple.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſounded the Trumpet in the Synagogue and ſtreets, that ſo they might be obſerved by more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they may have glory of men]</hi> 1. Or, <hi>That they may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by men,</hi> when they ſhould give alms, that they themſelves, and that others might glorifie God, ſo the poor ſhould have the alms, and God ſhould have the glory, and they might have the comfort of their actions; but here while they give a peny to the poor they ſteal that from God, <hi>viz.</hi> his glory, which they eſteem more of then a thouſand worlds.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is lawfull to have reſpect to the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to do good duties partly in relation to the relation which we ſhall have from God, but never in reference to the praiſe and glory we ſhall have from men; but here it is not, that they might have glory of God, or that God might have glory of men, but that they might have glory of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of men, the main thing that they were to look after, was their relief, not their praiſe: but here while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come to give to the poor, they do indeed come to receive applauſe both from poor and rich.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verily]</hi> 1. The word <hi>Amen,</hi> tranſlated here <hi>verily,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is a word of aſſeveration, as here and in moſt places; nay ſometimes ſo ſtrong an aſſeveration that it hath the nature of an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119918:70"/>oath, the word in the Greek is <hi>Amen,</hi> Heb. 6.14. Sometimes it is uſed by way of option or wiſhing, ſo is the laſt word of the. Lords Prayer, and the laſt word of the whole Bible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is obſervable that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel uſes three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which no other Evangeliſt uſeth, the firſt is the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this aſſeveration; the ſecond that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is called woman; the third, that <hi>John</hi> is called the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved, and alwayes ſo in his own, never in any of the reſt of the Goſpels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I. ſay unto you] Vid.</hi> Chap. 5. verſ. 18, 22. upon theſe words.</p>

                     <hi>They have their reward]</hi> 1. It is not ſaid, they have the praiſe of men, for that they may miſſe of, but howſoever if they aim at the praiſe of men, they have their reward, <hi>i.e.</hi> all their reward that ever they ſhall have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since our Saviour brings this as a heavy curſe that will light upon them, it follows, that it is a miſerable thing to have no reward, but what we have in this life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is not ſaid, they have a reward, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that is, that which they account a reward, not that which is a reward.</p>

We not onely not keep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and exactly remember what we give to the poor, but at that very time when we give it, we are not much to make what we give; it is not ſaid, that after thou giveſt thine alms thy left hand ſhould not know, but <hi>when</hi> thou giveſt, at that very time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The proverbial ſenſe is this, that none, though they were as near to us as our left-hand is to our right, ſhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with what we give to the poor, but that our alms ſhould be carried with the greateſt ſecrecy that might be; ſo that if it were poſſible, but one part of our ſelves ſhould know it: Or, 2. Thus it is in another reſpect to ſhew how private our alms ſhould be, when one gives a thing with both hands it cannot be carried ſo ſecret as when one gives with one, therefore when we would convey a piece of money into the hand of another ſo, that no one ſhould ſee us, we do it with one of our hands not with both, <hi>Let not thy left-hand know what thy right hand does,</hi> that is, do not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119918:70"/>give alms with both hands, ſince you may give them more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not ſaid, <hi>Let not thy left hand know to whom thy right hand gives,</hi> but <hi>what thy right hand gives;</hi> for it is lawfull, nay we ought to conſider whether the perſons to whom we give want or no, and we ought rather to ſome kinde of perſons, then to others, as the Scripture hath commanded us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Which ſeeth in ſecret]</hi> 1. But if thou ſhalt ſay, If neither I, nor other men take notice of what I give, how ſhall it come to be known? and if it be not known, how ſhall I ever be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it? Our Saviour doth here ſeem to anſwer; Yes, there is one that ſees though thy alms be ſo ſecret that neither thy ſelf nor others ſee them, and he that thus ſees is one that will not keep any thing ſecret that may be for thy good to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for it is thy Father that thus ſees in ſecret.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That which is the Saints comfort is the hypocrites fear and condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> That God ſees in ſecret. It is a ſad thing when all our comforts depend upon this impoſſibility, <hi>viz.</hi> That God knows nor our thoughts.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119918:71"/>Chriſt ſhall proclaim all thine alms, yea divers of thine alms which thou thy ſelf didſt not know, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſince it was not the leaſt part of the honour of him, whom the King delighted to honour, that he ſhould be arraied and crowned, and his horſe led, and proclamation made, and all this by one of the Kings moſt noble Princes: So doubtleſſe it will be the greateſt part of the glory of thoſe that are charitable, that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall crown them with a crown of glory, and array them with the robes of his own righteouſneſſe, and proclaim and ſay in the preſence of the whole world, <hi>Comeye bleſsed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All that you have by your blowing the trumpet, is, that men know that you give to the poor, and that men honour you for ſo doing, but here the Lord ſhall not only make it known, and you ſhall be honoured before men and Angels by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for giving alms; but beſides his honouring he ſhall reward you; as when the King ſhall give ſome great gift in the preſence of all his Nobles to ſome poor man for ſome ſmall ſervice he hath done him, the man is honoured by having the gift given openly before Nobles, but the gift it ſelf is a great part of the reward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reward that God ſhall give is certain, if thou giveſt thy alms ſecretly, but the praiſe thou expecteſt from men is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, if thou giveſt them openly: it may be thoſe poor that come and receive nothing will rail at thee, thoſe that thou giveſt unto may murmur at thee that thou giveſt them no more, and they that ſtand by and behold, may more blame thee for thy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie then praiſe thee for thine alms; thou bloweſt the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet that men may come to ſee thee, but it may be their buſineſſe or wiſdom is ſuch that they neither can nor will come out to ſee thee, but when the trumpet ſhall be blown at the laſt day, then the Sea and the grave, and hell it ſelf ſhall ſend forth all their priſoners, and they and all the world ſhall behold thee openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded that gaveſt thine alms in ſecret.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The word that we tranſlate <hi>reward,</hi> properly ſignifies to render or return what we formerly received, and this is the ſame that <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.17. there it is, <hi>He that pities the poor leuds to the Lord,</hi> not he that gives to the poor, for a man may give out of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, as here, and not out of pity; ſo here our Saviour bids us do our alms, but the word ſignifies pity, the word pity rather then relieve is uſed in both theſe places, to ſhew that all are bound to pity, though every one is not bound to relieve them; the reaſon is, becauſe all are able to pity, though all are not able to relieve the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119918:72"/>poor, the poor themſelvs are able to pity; nay in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they have of the ſmart of poverty, they can eaſilier pity then the rich, that which you give out of pity to the poor, and love to the Lord, is lent unto the Lord; but what you give for to be ſeen of men, is lent to men, and they are to repay you, God will not.</p>

                     <hi>And when thou prayeſt]</hi> 1. It is not ſufficient to be carefull to avoid hypocriſie in one holy duty, but in all; for Satan is like a flie, for the prince of devils is called the prince of flies, drive away a flie from one place it will light upon another: So though Satan be driven away from thine alms, he will light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, As in reſpect of Satan, ſo alſo in reſpect of God it is not ſufficient to be right in one duty, for one duty zealouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly performed, will not excuſe or ſtand by way of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ill performance of another, he that keeps one day to the Lord, it is more inexcuſable if he keeps the next day to the devil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If <hi>when</hi> be taken for <hi>whenſoever,</hi> or <hi>as often as thou prayeſt,</hi> then the obſervation is, That as in different duties the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one with care makes it not needleſſe how we perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as above is obſerved; ſo in the ſeveral acts or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the ſame duty, the performing of it often well ſhould not make us ſecure, nor can infallibly aſſure us that afterwards we may not perform it ill; he that rowes thirty ſtrokes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails againſt the ſtream, if he omits the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſtroke he will ſurely be carried back again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you take <hi>when,</hi> as if our Saviour had ſaid not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but at the very inſtant of prayer <hi>You ſhall not be,</hi> &amp;c. then the obſervation is, That our preparation to holy duties cannot be ſo great, as to put our hearts into ſuch a ſpiritual frame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we need not at the very inſtant of performance of the duty obſerve what we do; for our hearts are not like a well-made watch, which being wound up once or twice a day, and being
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119918:72"/>ſet right, will go ſo for many hours, though you neither obſerve nor direct the wheels in their courſe; but like a ſhip which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your eye be on the compaſſe, and your hand on the helm, will be driven out of the way and ſplit upon rocks; or like a writers pen, which be it never ſo well made and prepared for writing, yet writes not one letter or tittle more then the hand makes it. <hi>When</hi> does not here properly command, but takes it for granted, that we will pray, for it is not <hi>If,</hi> but <hi>when thou prayeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou]</hi> 1. It may be the meaning is, that in private prayer we ſhould not ſtand, nor love to ſtand in the Synagogues, but <hi>when ye pray,</hi> that is, when there are publick Aſſemblies met together to pray, then we may joyn with them whereſoever they meet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou,</hi> that is, though all elſe ſhould do ſo, yet do not thou, for we muſt not follow a multitude to do evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayeſt]</hi> 1. As the holineſſe of thy perſon cannot priviledge thee from temptation, for Satan ſtrove with <hi>Michael,</hi> and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Chriſt, ſo neither can there be any duty ſo holy wherein thou canſt have ſo near a communion with God, but Satan can come between to tempt thee, for prayer of all duties brings us neareſt unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To do any thing for the applauſe of men, is at the beſt but vanity, but to do works of religion for the praiſe of men, is to make God our footſtool.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though our actions muſt be the ſame in many particulars with hypocrites, yet the frame of our ſpirits muſt alwayes be different: we muſt do what they do, but never be what they are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When thou prayeſt,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. <hi>Thou,</hi> is as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Let the hypocrites do what they will, but <hi>when thou,</hi> &amp;c. And as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did ſay, <hi>Do you what you will, but I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not <hi>when ye pray,</hi> to ſhew that this direction is not for publick, or to condemn publick prayer, but a Directory only for private devotions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor is this a direction for ejaculatory prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or if we do as they do, <hi>i.e.</hi> if we do pray in Synagogues as they do, yet we muſt do it with another frame of ſpirit, for it is not ſaid, Do not as they do, but be not as they are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their fault was not praying in the Synagogue, but their affecting it, to ſit in the uppermoſt room, is not a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119918:73"/>ſinne, but the love of ſitting there is.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Standing was the uſual poſture in prayer amongſt the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Job</hi> 30.20. except in dayes of humiliation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Love is to be joyned to both the words, and they lov'd to pray ſtanding for two reaſons, 1. Becauſe they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be ſeen. 2. Becauſe they did not like thoſe kindes of prayer to which proſtration was proper, for their prayers were generally Thankſigivings rather then confeſſions; <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Lord, I thank,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Standing may be taken for continuance, for our Saviour condemns them for their long prayers.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They did not only frequent their own Synagogue, but went to divers others to be taken notice of.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The corners of the ſtreet may be ta'ne two wayes, either as if they went into ſome corner of the ſtreet, pretending to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſight of men, that they might have not only the praiſe of their praying, but their humility, and did ſeem to caſt away praiſe, but ſo that they might take it at the rebound: Or elſe it may be taken for that place where two ſtreets meet, becauſe that place was moſt publick.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It ſhows they did not pray in high-wayes nor in villages, but in Cities or great Towns, for the others have no ſtreets, all to ſhew that the publickneſſe of the place was the cauſe of their choice of it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This does not contradict <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. for they are faulted here, not becauſe they deſired their works, but themſelves ſhould be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is extreamly againſt the very end of prayer to deſire that we may be ſeen, for the reaſon why we pray, is, that our prayers may be heard, and not that our perſons may be ſeen, for the reſt, <hi>vid.</hi> ver. 2.</p>

                     <hi>Our Father which art in heaven: Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give vs this day our daſly bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debters. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THe prayer is divided into four parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Preparatory part, or Introduction, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The body of the Prayer, which is divided into two parts, Supplications, which are four, and Deprecations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Doxology, <hi>For thine is the kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Or it may be brought, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed, as a reaſon why we beg theſe things of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Concluſion of all, <hi>viz. Amen;</hi> or if you will, the praying over the whole prayer again in one word.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome ſmall differences between our Tranſlation and the Original.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, <hi>Oh Our Father,</hi> not <hi>Our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, the word <hi>art</hi> is not in the Original.</p>
                  <p>The third, that which we tranſlate <hi>Heaven,</hi> is <hi>Heavens</hi> in the plural number.</p>
                  <p>For the expoſitory part there is little difficulty, I am only in this, that it is ſaid, that God is in heaven,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt take heed that we do not underſtand it excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if God were no where elſe, as in <hi>Job</hi> 22.15. that God walked in the circuits of the heaven For God is as truly and as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in earth as in heaven; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens is not able to contain him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt take heed of thinking that God is ſo in heaven as a place which makes him happy, for if ſo, he ſhould neither be infinitely nor eternally happy, for heaven is not the happineſſe of God, but God the happineſſe of heaven, the heaven of heavens. God is ſaid to be in heaven,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of manifeſtation, here we ſee him but darkly, there face to face.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of union.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of fruition all theſe ſhall be abundantly greater, for their own faith ſhall be turned into viſion, our hope into fruition, our love into union.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:119918:75"/>
                  <p>Or elſe this may be added, not onely not as a limitation of Gods preſence, but to diſtinguiſh him from our earthly fathers; there are two words that diſtinguiſh God from our natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1. That he is in heaven. 2. The word <hi>Our,</hi> ſince there is none that is the Father of all the elect, ſave one God. We may conſider theſe words either in themſelves, or as a preface or introduction to the prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In themſelves, the firſt truth therefore in the words is this, that God is the Father of all his people. Now God does not take empty titles upon himſelf, but fils up whatſoever relation he takes upon himſelf to the utmoſt, therefore whatſoever the tendereſt, lovingeſt parents in the world are to their children, God is much more:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have our beings under God from our parents, but we have our beings more from God then from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe we have it originally from God, but from them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have our bodies from our parents, but our ſouls from God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have our being but our depraved being from our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but our well-being from God. By generation we have it from our parenrt, by regeneration from God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though we have our bodies in ſome ſenſe from our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet we have them much more from God, for a mother knows not her childe before it be born, whether it be beautifull or deformed, knows not what parts it hath, and what it wants, but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. in his book are all our members written.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Parents know their children, there are many Kings and Monarchs that know not their ſervants, but none but knows their children. Can you go to any mother that cannot tell you how many children ſhe has, and their names? but God knows his children farre better then any parent, and to help our faith God does uſe many rare expreſſions, and to ſignifie what ſpecial notice he takes of his children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. to write down their names is not ſo much as to engrave them, and God thinks no matter good enough to engrave his peoples name in; the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt ſtones in the world he muſt have for them to be engraven in; nay he will have their names engraven twice, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. and <hi>Aaron</hi> is not to appear before him, but with the names of his people upon his heart; nay to ſhew that there is no precious ſtone or any thing under heaven that is good
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119918:76"/>enough to engrave his peoples names on, he engraves them in the palms of his own hands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.16. that is the firſt thing God knows his people by name, and that is a wonderfull ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 2. A wonderfull comfort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God knows the diſpoſitions of his children, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He does more then any father, for he numbers the very hairs of their heads. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30. Nay, as God knows his people, ſo he never forgets them, a father may, nay a mother which is fulleſt of affections; nay a mother may forget her ſucking childe, who as yet has not by any diſobedience provoked her to forſake him, for ſhe is not only the nurſe of it, but the mother of it, the ſon of her womb. Nay a mother may forget though ſhe has but one, the ſonne of her womb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. Nay all women may forget, for it is ſaid, though they ſhould, for a woman to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get one childe if ſhe has many; but for all the women in the world to forget their childe whiles it ſucks, though they have no more, is a kinde of an impoſſibility, yet it is more impoſſible for God to forget his people. Nay, but God ſets down the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo why he cannot forget his people, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. Nay, there is none of his people can be ſo diſguiſed by ſinne, but he knows them, ſcarce any one would have taken <hi>David</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting adultery and murder for a childe of God: and <hi>Peter</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forſwearing Chriſt; by the Parable of the Prodigal this is made clear unto us, for it is ſaid that the Father of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal knew him afarre off, though he muſt needs be exceedingly altered in ſo long a time, and by his keeping Swine and being almoſt ſtarved, and by his ſtrange apparel, yet his father knew him afar off, this is but to ſhew us that God knows his people in their greateſt diſguiſes of ſinne. We may take a childe of God for an hypocrite and an hypocrite for a childe of God, but this is our comfort, God knows who are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The care of God towards his children is farre greater then that of Parents, we reade not only of one but of both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents forſaking their children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. where is there a parent in the world that takes care that his childe loſes not a hair without his knowledge? but concerning God it is ſaid, that he numbers the hairs of our heads, and it is brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, to ſhew the ſpecial providence that God has of his people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word <hi>Father</hi> does not only ſhew the love of God, but what kinde of love that he bears unto us, for the love of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119918:76"/>differs and exceeds other loves thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the freeſt love in the world, for though a childe be never ſo great a charge, yet a tender mother had rather work night and day then her childe ſhould want, much leſſe ſhould die, though it be never ſo great a trouble when the childe is ſick, ſo that it breaks her ſleep, when her breſts are ſo ſore that the childe ſucks almoſt as much bloud as milk. Nor is it beauty in the childe that makes her love him, for it is ſaid, the mother forgets her pains as ſoon as ſhe knows a childe is born into the world, before ſhe knows whether it be beautifull or deformed. Where is there a loving mother in the world that will change her ſickly and deformed childe for the beautifulleſt and healthfulleſt in the world. Nor is the mothers love cauſed by the childes love, for ſhe loves the childe, and the childe knows not how to love, nor what it is to be beloved. The love of a friend to a friend, or a wiſe to her husband is begun and continued by ſome or all theſe grounds, either by profit, pleaſure, beauty, love or all. That Gods love is ſuch to us, ſo free, grounded upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in us, he has mercy, becauſe he will have mercy, and loves us becauſe he loves us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the laſtingeſt love. Nothing can take it off, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. the Prodigal ſonne ſhewed no love to his father, he could not endure to dwell with him nor near him, but went into a far countrey, ſpent all amongſt harlots, if he had loſt by trading it had been ſomething; to be poor and wicked, nay but to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed by wickedneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So for <hi>Davids</hi> love to <hi>Abſolom, Abſolom</hi> had done much one would think to take off the love of the tendereſt father in the world, he had murdered <hi>Amnon,</hi> and ſought his fathers kingdom, and his life, and had abuſed his fathers concubine before the Sunne and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a fact of that nature that it made him irreconcilable; one would think <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> was a wiſe man, the wiſeſt in that matter in the world, and he thought ſo, and counſels to that purpoſe, that he might put him out of any hopes of reconciliation, yet <hi>David</hi> forgets not his fatherly affections, and does as much as he can to excuſe <hi>Abſolom,</hi> charges his Army to deal gently with the young man <hi>Abſolom,</hi> in which he doth ſeem to ſay thus, Thoſe his crimes muſt be imputed much to his youth, he was a young man, and <hi>David</hi> alſo in another caſe ſhews, the wonderfull love of Parents to their children, that nothing can take it off: the little childe in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. being unlawfully begotten was a living monument of <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne and ſhame, yet when it was ſick he prayed and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119918:77"/>faſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, and nothing more then in his tender affection to his children. A wife may ceaſe to be a wife, ſhe may juſtly upon ſome occaſion be divorced; a friend may ceaſe to be a friend, nay we ought to ceaſe our friendſhip and familiarity with him, when he grows ſcandalous and wicked, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. but a childe can never ceaſe to be a childe: it is laſtinger alſo <hi>à parte antè,</hi> one loves ones childe as ſoon as it is born, but ones friend a long after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the greateſt love, eſpecially if we compare the love of Parents to their children, and that of children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that is, Parents love their children farre more then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren their Parents. Now this is a wonderful comfort for any one that loves God, and it is moſt comfort to them that love God moſt, to think with themſelves, Well, I love God much, but this is my comfort, I am ſure he loves me more, for God is and will be a conquerour over all people; for as he conquers the wicked, if they are proud he is above them, if they are ſubtil he goes beyond them, ſo he conquers his people alſo; his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are above their praiſes, his mercies beyond their thanks, and his thoughts of love towards them, are as farre above their thoughts of love towards him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11. And as the word <hi>Father</hi> is a wonderfull comfort, ſo it is an engaging word, it engages us to ſeveral duties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To honour God, which is ſo proper a duty to a childe as a childe, that God ſayes, If I am a Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſecond Commandment does not ſay, Thou ſhalt obey thy Father, but thou ſhalt <hi>honour thy Father;</hi> not but that they ought to obey them too, but becauſe honour is the principle from which all other of their actions ſhould flow: but of that more in the firſt Petition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obedience, which muſt nor be ſlaviſh and mercenary, as if it were forced. It is the voice of a ſlave to ſay, What muſt I do? The voice of a ſon to ſay, What may I do to pleaſe my Father?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Imitation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. Imitation is ſo proper to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that a childe ſcarce doth any thing which it ſees not, and ſcarce ſees any thing which it does not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſidence, upon this account our Saviour bids us not to <hi>take thought what we ſhould eat, or what we ſhould drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall we ſhall be cloathed,</hi> and he layes the ſtreſſe of all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon this very word <hi>Father,</hi> and indeed this very word <hi>Father</hi> has more in it to ſupport conſidence, then promiſes have,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119918:77"/>and indeed a childe does not ſo properly rely upon promiſes as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relation: if ſo be one ſhould come to a childe and ask him, why he is ſo confident that his father will provide for him, and ſay to him, Did your father ever promiſe you that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee you want? he might very well ſay, whether my father promiſed me ſo or no, I cannot well tell, nor much regard, this is my ſupport, I know he is my father; So that the voice of a childe, ſaying, Father, give me ſuch a thing, to plead work is like a ſervant, to plead promiſes has too much of the ſtranger in it, for a ſtranger will truſt an able man if he has bonds and engagements; but to plead the name of Father is like a childe; for when does a childe ever preſſe his father, and bring witneſſe that he ſaid that he would not let him ſtarve? he thinks it enough to call him father, and indeed in that word is vertually contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all promiſes that is for the good of the childe.</p>
                  <p>And as this relation engageth us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heſe and many other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in reference to God; ſo it obliges us to many duties in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence eſpecially to the Saints:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It teaches us not to exalt our ſelves above our brethren: ſuppoſe we have a little more wealth or honours then they, one is but like a golden letter which makes a finer ſhow, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more then another: ſo riches makes one ſignifie no more as to God, it is grace only that makes one truly uſefull. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were two men of which one had ten thouſand a year, and the other ten thouſand and a peny a year, were it not a vain thing for him that had the overplus of a peny to magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above, and deſpiſe the other, becauſe of that inconſiderable ſumme of addition: that peny a year carries a farre greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to a thouſand pound then all the riches in the world does to grace, for a peny may be multiplied to reach and out go that ſumme, but by multiplying riches never ſo much, you can never make them amount to be worth the leaſt ſpark of grace. Rich <hi>Abraham</hi> layes poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. for as thoſe that ſate at meat did uſually expreſſe their intimacy by laying thoſe whom they would ſhew moſt love unto in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for to make <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome as a place diſtinct from heaven from this place, as the Papiſts do, is a groſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond duty (from this, that God is our Father) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints, is love, there ſhould be no ſtrife and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt them; this was the argument that <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed to <hi>Lot, Joſeph</hi> to his brethren, and <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſtrove together.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:119918:78"/>
                  <p n="2">2. From the words, <hi>Which art in heaven,</hi> conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not as an introduction to the prayer, obſerve</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Dignity of the Saints, the Lord of heaven and earth is their Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Saints are ſtrangers here on earth, for <hi>ubi pater ibipatria,</hi> and indeed the world uſes them as ſtrangers. Nay, it uſes God and Chriſt ſo, it hated me ſaies Chriſt, before it hated you. God and Saints are both ſtrangers upon earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.12. <hi>David</hi> does not ſay, that he is a ſtranger to God, but a ſtranger with God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It teaches the people of God, that they ſhould not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the carriage of the world towards them; dogs will ſnarl and bark at ſtrangers, but not at thoſe of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhews us thus much, that if heaven be our country we muſt be making homeward; as we are ſtrangers, ſo we muſt be pilgrims too. If a poor childe ſhould have been brought up as an out-caſt in a very mean way, and caſt into priſon, and ſhould after underſtand that ſome great Monarch was his father, and ſhould to aſſure him of his love and relation to him, ſend letters and rich jewels, ſuch as thoſe that delivered them to him he knew was not able to purchaſe, and ſhould ſend him word that ſhortly he would ſend his Nobles for him, and break the priſon door; would he be ſad when he heard that his father would ſend for him and receive him, that the priſon doors were breaking open that he might come forth? God hath told the Saints in his Word, that they are his children, and has conveyed the rich jewels of his graces to them by the hands of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the words as they are an introduction to prayer, then obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In general, that we ought not to be raſh when we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God, but to uſe ſome preparation before we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſo holy a duty; for we are like viols hung by, they muſt be tuned before they can make muſick, and though we finde our ſelves in tune and ſit for worldly imployments, yet we muſt have a higher preparation or tuning for religious duties, to be tuned the plain way will ſerve well enough for worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but we muſt be tuned like <hi>Davids</hi> harp, to fit us to ſound out the praiſes of God. Indeed we ſhould perform temporal things with ſpiritual hearts, but there muſt be a more ſpiritual frame and preparation of heart in holy duties; Chriſt ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119918:78"/>a ſecond bleſſing to the bread and wine, when he ſet them apart as ſacramental elements of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you take theſe words as an introduction to prayer, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we ought to have high and good thoughts of God when we pray unto him, or elſe we ſhall never perform the duty with that confidence and reverence that we ſhould do. Neither of theſe alone will ſerve to affect us with that ſpiritual frame of heart as is required, and therefore the Heathens with all their philoſophical notions of the greatneſſe of God, could not raiſe up their hearts to a true confidence for thoſe notions, did at beſt but amaze and aſtoniſh them, it could not breed in them confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; nay further we muſt not only have an apprehenſion of the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God in general, and reſt there, but we muſt get and endeavour to know our intereſt in God, for <hi>gracious God</hi> is a word which ſignifies the goodneſſe of God in general, but <hi>Our Father</hi> ſignifies relation and intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence we learn, That we are not to pray to any but to God, not to Angels, for God by the Apoſtle forbids us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. and the Angels themſelves forbid us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.9. Nay the words are ſpoke as it were in paſſion; for when a man is in paſſion and would have a thing haſtily done or left undone, his expreſſions are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abrupt and broken, he is ſo earneſt that he cannot ſtay whilſt his tongue do ſpeak ſo many words as will ſignifie what he would have, but by his pronunciation and geſture at the ſame time ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the reſt of that which he is unwilling to ſtay from ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying untill his tongue can ſpeak the whole: Nay, in paſſion the tongue ſpeaks otherwiſe then by words, <hi>viz.</hi> by pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, and the words in the original are only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>ſee not</hi> in worſhipping Angels we make God angry, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels angry; and prayer is ſuch an act of worſhip that <hi>adoratie</hi> which ſignifies worſhip is properly praying too, nor may we pray to Saints, for <hi>Elias</hi> wiſhes <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that if he had any thing that he would have him to prevail in with God for him, he bid him ask him before he went to heaven, for afterwards it was in vain to deſire any thing from him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9. by the zeal of the Saints on earth we may gueſſe at the zeal of the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If the Apoſtles were enraged as to their outward carriage ſeemingly as moſt to madneſſe when the <hi>Lyſtrians</hi> would have worſhipped them, ſurely if the Saints did but know of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatry that is committed towards them, it would
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119918:79"/>certainly, if it were poſſible, interrupt their very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the word <hi>Our,</hi> we learn, That we muſt pray for others as well as for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is of great comfort, that whereſoever God has a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to call upon his name, Every one of Gods children has a ſtock of prayers going for him, and though thou canſt not pray for thy ſelf, yet others pray for thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That God is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> it ſhews, That our thoughts ſhould be heavenly in the duty of prayer, though it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to lift up our eyes to heaven, as our Saviour did, <hi>John</hi> 17. for the Publican durſt not lift up his eyes thither, and yet was accepted.</p>
                  <p>Two things there are in this and all prayers:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What are the things we deſire. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What are the things we are engaged to do, for every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is an engagement to do what in us lies to obtain the things we prayed for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt take the words of this prayer in the largeſt ſenſe, in reſpect of the acception of the word, except ſome words of the prayer, or ſome other parts of Scripture puts a limitation to them; and therefore <hi>Kingdom</hi> being differenced from other Kingdoms, by the word <hi>thy,</hi> is not to be taken for the powers and Kingdoms of this world, and therefore the word <hi>Our</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken, as if we prayed for every particular man in the world, ſince we only pray for thoſe whoſe Father God is or may be hereafter for ought we know, hence will it follow that we muſt extend the Kingdom of heaven to the Kingdome of grace and glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They muſt be extended to the utmoſt ſenſe of words, in reſpect of the perſons or things prayed for; ſo when we pray for the <hi>forgiveneſſe of our treſpaſses,</hi> we do intend both all kindes and all numbers of ſins, as ſins of ignorance, infirmity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every particular ſin of thoſe kindes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is to be extended univerſally in reſpect of places; ſo when we deſire that Gods name <hi>ſhould be hallowed,</hi> we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that it ſhould be hallowed in this or that place, but in the whole world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of time, it is to be extended to all time, but that time, which is not compatible with the nature of prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> the time paſt, or that which is not compatible with the nature of the thing we prayed for, as if we take <hi>thy Kingdom
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119918:79"/>come</hi> for the day of judgement, it is not proper to ſay that we ſhould pray that ſhould come now and again a thouſand years hence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In reſpect of degrees in all thoſe Petitions to which there is no limitation given. When we deſire that Gods name ſhould be hallowed, we deſire that it ſhould be hallowed to the utmoſt, and ſo that <hi>his will ſhould be done,</hi> and that our <hi>treſpaſses</hi> ſhould be fully forgiven.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If there be ſeveral wayes that the Petition may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, we include them all, as the name of God may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in our thoughts, words, lives.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In every Petition we pray for all the means that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible for the obtaining of that thing included in that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We do pray for the preventing if abſent, or removing if preſent all that may hinder the mercy we pray for, in whole or in part.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In the four firſt Petitions are included Deprecations, and in the Deprecations are included the contrary Petitions. When we pray for holineſſe vertually, we pray againſt ſin, as in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Commandments the negative are included, in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative the affirmative.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Though all things that we are to pray for may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſome of theſe Petitions, yet many things may be reduced to more then one, but more immediately to one, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely in other reſpects to other Petitions.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That in every Petition is vertually included. 1. Our want of the thing we pray for. 2. Our neceſſity of having of it. 3. Our acknowledgement of our inability to obtain the thing we pray for, or to avoid the evil we pray againſt, without Gods ſpecial aſſiſtance and mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every Petition includes an engagement to uſe the means, and to avoid and remove all impediments that might hinder us from obtaining the thing we prayed for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hallowed be thy Name]</hi> 1. By the name of God is meant his Titles, Attributes, Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>hallow</hi> or ſanctifie is a very high expreſſion: it is more then praiſe or honour, for theſe we may give to men, we muſt honour our Parents. It is more then wonder and admiration, for we may wonder at things that are evil, as Chriſt did at the unbelief and hardneſſe of heart of the Jews. To ſanctifie or hallow the name of God is the higheſt expreſſion that can be;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119918:80"/>what we account ſacred we may not put to any common uſe, but for things that we account never ſo excellent, if not ſacred, we may uſe in the meaneſt offices, as we may cut glaſſe with a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though we ſell a diamond of never ſo great value for a farthing, it may be folly, it is not prophaneneſſe for <hi>Eſau</hi> to have ſold his birth-right if it had conſiſted onely in temporals, and had had no ſpiritual priviledges annexed to it.</p>
                  <p>We are to ſanctifie God in our thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
                  <p>In our thoughts we ſanctifie God two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Deus eſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per omne verbum, &amp; ſuper omne filentium omnem ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, &amp; omnem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratione, omnem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem &amp; omnem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſin, ſuper omne quod eſt, &amp; ſuper omne quod non eſt, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per omne quod poteſt eſse, &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per omne quod non poteſt eſſe.</note> Thus, raiſe thy thoughts as high as poſſibly as thou canſt, and when thy thoughts are higheſt, pureſt, holieſt, that thou canſt poſſibly frame, then know that God is infinitely more above them then the heavens are above the earth, and know that thou doſt not conſiderably honour God in thy thoughts till all the actings of thy underſtanding be loſt in admirings; nor doſt thou conſiderably honour God by the actings of thy love, till they be loſt in extacies and raviſhments of ſpirit, and both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will yield themſelves up, as overwhelmed and conquered by the glorious excellencies of God, for God is not only above our words, but above our ſilence, not only above our underſtanding, but admiration: But take heed that in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your underſtanding you do not offer to make a thought of the eſſence of God, for we cannot know him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt take heed of under pretence of honouring God in one Attribute to diſhonour him in another; the high thoughts that you have of his excellencies muſt not leſſen the thoughts that you have of his goodneſſe, knowing that the Majeſty of God doth not put bounds to his goodneſſe; be ſure that his goodneſſe is as incomprehenſible as any of the reſt of his Attributes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou honoureſt God in thy thoughts when there is ſuch an holy dread of the Majeſty, preſence and holineſſe of God, that thy thoughts are kept in one, ſo that thou dareſt no more think an impure thought, then do an impure action in the open ſtreet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of words, thou doſt hallow the name of God,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of thy words themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of thy pronunciation alſo, when both thy words and pronunciation are ſuch as are ſutable to thoſe high, good and holy thoughts thou haſt or oughteſt to have of God, and fit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119918:80"/>to raiſe the ſame thoughts in others; when thou ſpeakeſt of God, ſpeak with as much reverence and feeling, as if thou ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt to God, and when thou ſpeakeſt to God, let the awe and dread of his Majeſty be as much upon thy ſpirit as thou verily believeſt would be if God immediately ſpoke to thee from heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By thy life and converſation thou doſt hallow the name of God, when thou doſt live ſutably to the truths, promiſes, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the reſt of the attributes of God; ſo that it may be ſaid of thee, that thou art a living Bible, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Corinthians, You are the epiſtle of Chriſt not writ with ink, but with the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the order of the Petition, obſerve, The glory of God being the firſt and chiefeſt thing that we are to deſire, it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the glory of God is to be preferred before all things, even our own, and the ſalvation of all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For certainly if any thing were to be preferred above it, it ought to be deſired before it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe God hath made all things for his own glory, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.16. Now the means are ſervants to the end, and the <hi>Servant is not above his maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath taken away all that glory, happineſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which he had beſtowed upon the fallen angels, becauſe they diſhonoured him. Now if their excellencies were better then the glory of God, God ſhould take more for his glory, then 'tis worth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the order obſerve, That we ought to deſire all other things, not only leſſer, but in reference to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſince the glory of God is better then all the world, it is a greater ſinne to rob God of his glory, then if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to rob the whole world: ſo much for the order, for the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We do tacitly acknowledge that we are not able ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to glorifie God: for firſt by reaſon of our ignorance we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what are the beſt means, and by reaſon of our impotence we cannot put in execution thoſe means we do know: we know that the way to glorifie God, is to have the Goſpel of Chriſt preached in power and purity thorowout the whole world. 3. By reaſon of our wickedneſſe we will not uſe the means that we can, but are very prone to diſhonour God.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:119918:81"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only not we, but not all the creatures in heaven and earth are able ſufficiently to glorifie God. So that not only <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 148. &amp; 150, &amp;c. but even the Angels, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. call for help. Nay, even Chriſt himſelf as man findes it too hard a task ſufficiently to glorifie his Father, <hi>John</hi> 12.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We deſire in this Petition, that God would beſtow upon us all means whatſoever, whether outward or inward, temporal or ſpiritual, whereby we and others are made able and willing to glorifie him, as that he would enlighten our underſtanding, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our hearts by manifeſting himſelf and his truths in his works, Word, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he would do this at all times and in all places, and that he would prevent or remove all things that might either in whole or in part hinder his glory, whether it be ignorance, atheiſm, idolatry, ſuperſtition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he would enable and encline us and others to the utmoſt to glorifie his name in our thoughts, affections, words and deeds.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Of power and providence, whereby he rules over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even reprobates, ſenſleſſe and irrational creatures, yea even devils themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Now the means for this end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The removing of thoſe things that hinder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The downfall of Antichriſt, and the fruſtrating of the power and plots of all other enemies of the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The poſitive means are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Outward, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Church may be furniſhed with all Goſpel-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Ordinances, and they furniſhed with gifts, and both purged from corruption, and countenanced and maintained by the civil Magiſtrate.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The poſitive inward means, is</p>
                  <p>The powerful and effectual cooperation of his Spirit with the outward means.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That God would be pleaſed ſo to exerciſe his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of power in the world, as may beſt conduce to theſe ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.]</hi> Three things are preſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are unable of our ſelves to do the will of God, although we deſire it, for whoſoever prays this Petition right, doth certainly deſire to do the will of God, but finding a diſability in himſelf, he deſires God to enable him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is none ſave onely God that can enable us to do it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are prone to rebell againſt the will of God, and to do the will of the fleſh, the world, and of the devil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are not only willing to do the will of God our ſelves, but alſo that God and men ſhould do it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are three things in the Petition.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What we deſire, that <hi>his will may be done.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Who are to do this will, <hi>men on earth.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. How it is to be done, <hi>As it is done in heaven.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The will of God is twofold:
<list>
                        <item>1. Secret.</item>
                        <item>2. Revealed: here it muſt be meant of this latter.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:119918:82"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe we cannot know the ſecret will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe otherwiſe we cannot do the will of God on earth, as the Angels do in heaven for they do it knowingly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the ſecret will of God, even reprobates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are and ſhall be ſubject to, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his revealed will we pray,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For active obedience to his commands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For paſſive obedience, or patience in bearing affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>Now the difference is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our active obeddience muſt be without even a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſire that the commands of God ſhould be repealed. But as to our paſſive obedience we may deſire the contrary to what God reveals <hi>(viz.)</hi> with ſubmiſſion ſtill to his ſecret will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All afflictions are even grievous to the people of God themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. but his commands are not grievous, 2 <hi>John</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not only to obey but love the commands of God, and that not only becauſe they are Gods commands, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are pure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. We are to hearken what the Lord will ſay unto us, and to deſire an increaſe of our knowledge of Gods commands, but we are not to deſire a fuller experimental knowledge of afflictions, as to deſire ſufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Affliction is not the object of our deſire, as the commands are, we deſire to know more of Gods commands, that we may do them, not more afflictions to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Corollaries.</label>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not contrary to this Petition to pray againſt affliction before they come, although God ſend us word that we will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with ſuch an affliction, as we ſee in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who prayed and prevailed, and in <hi>David,</hi> whoſe prayer, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 12. though not literally granted, yet was he heard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither is it againſt this command to pray for removal of afflictions already fallen upon us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although we are to bear afflictions patiently when we ſee the hand of God plainly in it, yet are we not to run into afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for ſo it is not thy will, but my will be done.</p>
                  <p>Who are to do this will? It is men on earth; we onely pray for thoſe that live on earth, and therfore neither for Angels, ſouls departed, nor devils, for ſome are below, others above our prayers.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. How it is to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is it not ſaid, <hi>Thy will be done on earth which is done in heaven,</hi> but <hi>as it is done in heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe there is ſome will of God that we here pray for obedience to, which is not in heaven <hi>(viz.)</hi> paſſive obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew, that in our obedience we are not only to look at the <hi>quid</hi> but <hi>quomodo</hi> of our obedience; for although we do all that is in Gods heart, as in <hi>Jehu,</hi> yet being it is not in a right manner, God may viſit ſuch obedience not only on us, but on our poſterities.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt ſetting down the manner of performing this duty,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119918:89"/>ſhews, that it is a duty not a ſinne, for Chriſt would never take ſo much care to direct us how to ſin, ſince that which in it ſelf is a ſin can never be well done.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Generally hypocrites do not uſe to do works publickly for acceptance of men, which materially are ſinne. Many other arguments may be produced to prove it, but that I intend not in theſe Annotations for the future to uſe any argument, but what are in the Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our Saviour here ſpeaks of private not publick faſts, as before he did of private and cloſet prayer; for as for publick prayers, we may love to pray in the Synagogues, to joyn with the Aſſemblies of the Saints, for it is lawful for us to wear ſackcloth, nay it is unlawfull for us to come with jewels and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments in publick faſts, nor indeed at all times in private faſts, as we ſee in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> whom God did commend as to that particular.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He doth not ſay, <hi>Do not what hypocrites do,</hi> but <hi>be not what hypocrites are,</hi> we may, we muſt do many things which they do; but though our outward actions ſhould be, yet our inward frame of hearts ſhould never be the ſame with theirs, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men generally erre in the matter, but hypocrites in the manner of performance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He may not be ſaid to faſt, that is forced to it for want of food, for the Apoſtle uſeth one word to expreſſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and another voluntary faſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Fifthly, The word tranſlated ſad countenance ſignifieth fiercely, ghoſtly, as that of a wilde beaſt, as of a Bear rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of her whelps, but our tranſlation is very full, for it is not alwayes taken in a bad ſenſe, for it is uſed of the Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.17.</p>
                  <p>All that was <hi>ſad</hi> in the Phariſees was their countenance, whereas in private faſts before men, all that ſhould be ſad in us is our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The word tranſlated <hi>Disfiguring their faces,</hi> ſignifies to corrupt, macerate, to deſtroy the very countenance, as if they were not the ſame men, whether it was by their often fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting they grew lean and meager, or elſe by dirting of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the word is uſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. and as ruſt takes away the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe metals that are ruſty; and as moths do eat holes in garments, ſo their countenance by often faſting, and not waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loſt their colour and figure.</p>

                     <hi>Lay not up treaſure]</hi> Firſt, Our Saviour having ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That our righteouſneſs muſt exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, i.e.</hi> the doctrinals of the Scribes, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticals of the Phariſees, and having ſhewed the errours of the Scribes in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, he comes in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter to ſhew the wickedneſſe of the Phariſees, and how our righteouſneſſe muſt exceed theirs.</p>
                  <p>Three ſpecial ſins he reproves, of which the Phariſees were eminently guilty, Hypocriſie, Covetouſneſſe and Pride, which they ſhewed in cenſuring of others; in this verſe and the reſt of this Chapter, our Saviour comes to ſpeak againſt covetouſneſſe, which conſiſts in two things; Either in deſire of abundance, or in the anxious deſire of things neceſſary; againſt the firſt he ſpeaks in this verſe. The word tranſlated <hi>Lay up,</hi> ſignifies not only to lay up, but to gather together: and in the word there are two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The prohibition, then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon: and one may paraphraſe the words thus: Do not gather abundance and lay them up for your ſelves, for though you lay them up for your ſelves, you are likely to have the leaſt ſhare of them, for either the moth, the ruſt, or the thief will deſtroy that which you have taken ſo much care to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:119918:90"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The reaſon why <hi>[for your ſelves]</hi> is put in, may be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe that generally thoſe that have none but themſelves to provide for are moſt covetous, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.8. where it is not ſaid children but childe, yet not ſo much as one to provide for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe that a covetous man of all men himſelf enjoyes leaſt of his riches, for a covetous man wanteth all things, but moſt of all what he hath, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 13.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.8. What thou layeſt up while thou liveſt, thou enjoyeſt not when thou dieſt, ſo that what you lay up you lay it not up for your ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is lawfull to lay up for our children, but not for our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. yet even then alſo we muſt not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Lay up abundance:</hi> That ſaying of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this caſe is worth the obſervation, <hi>Si multos habueris filios, ſed Chriſtus unus, ſi nullo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> unicus;</hi> the way to make thy children poor, is, not to make the poor thy children.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is impoſſible by laying treaſure on earth to make that part of thy ſelf which is not thy ſelf rich, <hi>viz.</hi> thy ſoul; for the ſoul of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are called <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Treaſures,</hi> to ſhew, that thoſe which hoard up wealth are immoderate in their deſires and layings up; for a little money may not be called a treaſure, and it is here, Lay not for your <hi>ſelf a treaſure,</hi> but <hi>treaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The corruptibleneſſe of earthly treaſures is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in this, that there is no kinde of creature, whether ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or inanimate, but hath power to deſtroy them. Nay, ſome of them may be deſtroyed by that creature which of all is eaſieſt deſtroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> a moth, which is but a flying worm, nay of all the weakeſt, for <hi>tinea dum tangitur frangitur;</hi> nay they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed from themſelves, from that corruption which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves breed, as the garment doth the moth, and metals ruſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The judgement of God is ſeen in this, That he hath appointed means for thoſe riches that are laid up to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; for the moth nor the ruſt do conſume thoſe things we uſe; nay the ruſt doth not only deſtroy thy riches, but brings deſtruction on thee, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There are many wayes to deſtroy our treaſures, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our eſtates do moulder away inſenſibly and by degrees, ſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119918:90"/>to be as a moth is taken <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.12. ſometimes by open violence, and all at once, when <hi>thieves break thorow and ſteal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, This ſhews the extraordinary care that rich men have to ſecure them, for <hi>breaking thorow</hi> ſhews that they are put up in ſtrong-holds; indeed ſome kinde of riches the moth and ruſt cannot deſtroy, as gold and precious ſtones, but thoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſecured from thieves; nor can all the ſtrength thou canſt make keep off their violence, for it is not ſaid a thief breaketh thorow, but thieves, if thou canſt ſecure them againſt private robberies, thou canſt not againſt publick invaſion, and indeed a covetous man little differs from a thief himſelf; thieves ſteal from the rich and covetous men from the poor, thou art a thief in keeping from the poor, and he is a thief in taking from the rich.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. No other treaſures are laid up for our ſelves, but what we beſtow upon the poor, thoſe we lay up in heaven we enjoy, thoſe in earth we loſe.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe things that are neceſſary to keep body and ſoul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo reduceth the neceſſaries of this life to food and raiment.</p>

                  <p>We may have a diligent care of providing for our families, but we muſt not have a care of diffidence, while we provide we muſt not deny or doubt of Gods providence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The words are not to be taken, as if we ſhould not take thought as gluttons do what curious diſh they may eat of, but it is the want of a poor man that knows not what to do, not as if out of abundance of choice, knew not what to take, but out of extream want knew not how to get any thing to eat or drink.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The word <hi>Mirimua</hi> does include a reaſon to dehort us from this care; for as we ſhould take care that our bodies be not torn in pieces, ſo ſhould we take care that our minde be not diſtracted, for a ſedated and quiet minde is a greater comfort then all thoſe things that our care can procure us, <hi>aequè miſer qui omnia concupiſcit, ac qui nihil poſſidet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon why we ſhould not be ſolicitous about ſuch things, but rely upon Gods goodneſſe, ſtand thus, He that will give a jewel will not deny a farthing, he gave you life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your caring or deſiring of it, and framed your body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your care; will he not much more give you that which is leſſe? Or thus, Since your life is ſuch a jewel, and your body ſuch a ſtately ſtructure, ſure he will not let the one fall to the ground, nor the other fall to decay for want of repairs, and loſe a thing of ſo great value for want of that which is of leſſe value, as food and raiment are in compariſon of life.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews the folly of gluttons, who live that they may
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119918:92"/>eat, as if food were better then life, as alſo the pride of ſome others who uſe faſhions that are hurtfull for their health, as if the raiment were better then the body.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Birds are named, becauſe of all creatures they ſeem to take the leſſe care for their food, many of them ſpend their whole life, as it were in ſinging, you might be as cheerfull as they, and be fed. Or</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fowls are named becauſe of the multitude of them, there being vaſt flocks of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe moſt of them do eat more proportionable to their bulk then beaſts do, and that is the reaſon as ſome ſay that <hi>Luke</hi> particularizes in the Raven, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9. and as others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the old Ravens leave their young in their neſt before they are able to provide for themſelves, but a worm breeding out of their dung creeps to their mouth and feeds them: Or as others, that they thruſt their young out of their neſt before they are able to flie up and down, and ſo diſinabled to provide for themſelves, and yet God feeds them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Why that no particular is here named, and named in <hi>Luke,</hi> to ſhew that God does not provide for particular fowls, but for all in general.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not ſaid for fowls, but for fowls of the air, to ſhew, that for divers fowls that are domeſtick we provide for them, but who provides for the fowls of the air?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They uſe no means to provide for themſelves as you do, <hi>for they neither ſow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He is not their father, but your father.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He is a heavenly father, and if he that is heavenly will provide for fowls, much more for you that are heavenly in reſpect of your ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Here is another argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods people are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119918:93"/>if we feed our dogs, will we let our children ſtarve? that in the former: if we take care of our earthen veſſels, will we not take care of our jewels? Every one of you are better then all they, as one jewel is more worth then the common veſſels of our houſe.</p>
                  <p>They have a double excellency over them, they are better, and they are much better then carrion brought to the neſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Your Father feeds them, that with them he may feed you, ſo that terminatively you are the object of his providence to them; ſo that when you ſee them fed you may ſee God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them for you.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119918:93"/>
                     <hi>Why's</hi> to be given for taking thought for raiment then for food, it being leſſe neceſſary for life, not onely becauſe that in divers Countreys a man may live without raiment alwayes, and in all Countreys farre longer then we can without food; and if we are well cloathed our garments will laſt us longer farre, ſo that there is not cauſe of renuing of them, as there is of our eating and drinking.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour doth confirm this from Gods providence, which does farre more abound in reſpect of raiment, both in reſpect of the excellency of the raiment, as alſo in reſpect of the meanneſſe of thoſe things which he cloaths, for the graſſe is not of ſo much excellency as the fowls of the air, and yet their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are farre more excellent in compariſon then the food of the fowls, for it is ſaid, <hi>That Solomon in all his glory was not arrared as they.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lilies,</hi> it may be meant ſpecially the <hi>Tulip,</hi> it being one kinde of Lily, and of all flowers the flower of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beauty and variety and of the leaſt uſe, for it is good nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for food nor phyſick, and therefore it is ſaid, it is caſt into the oven, but eſpecially concerning his colour and beauty is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, for Violets, nor Roſes, nor any other flowers differ comparably from one another in colour as this doth, and here is added <hi>The Lilies of the field,</hi> not of our garden, concerning which we ſeem to do ſomething for them by our care, <hi>But who cloatheth the Lilies of the fields?</hi> Further, they do nothing towards their cloathing, <hi>They neither ſpin nor toil,</hi> &amp;c. you do both, <hi>yet God cloaths them;</hi> nay he cloaths them better then any man was cloathed. Kings generally are the richeſt arrayed, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſicenteſt of Kings, as we reade of, was <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet <hi>Solomon</hi> was not only not ordinarily cloathed as well as they, nay in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, nay in the entertainment of Embaſſadours, nay <hi>in all his glory he was not arrayed as one of theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But you will ſay, How is this true? was not all the robes of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo excellent as the cloathing of the Lilies? In this the Lilies did exceed his cloathing, their colours were natural, his artificial, and ſo it exceeds as much as a native beauty doth paint; a beautiful woman is far more beautiful then the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of painting; but indeed this cannot eaſily be made out, for our Saviour bids us <hi>conſider the Lilies,</hi> and there need a great deal of conſideration to diſcover it; and from it we may learn thus much, In the meaneſt of Gods creatures God has ſhewn ſo much wiſdom, that it needs the wiſeſt mans ſtudy to fathour
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119918:94"/>its depth. Nay ſometimes God doth put abundance of honour upon thoſe things which ſeem moſt mean, in ſo much that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> which was little better then an Atheiſt, in his conſideration of the ſtructure of the head, and other parts of the body, is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as to the knowledgement of God, yet when he comes to conſider the foot ſtands admiring, and confeſſes a Deity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You may ſee how that from every creature of God, if we would but conſider it, we might gain abundance of ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; no Chymiſt in the world can make ſuch a rare extract of the creature as a Chriſtian, they make medicines for fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, gouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the creature, but they cannot draw from them an antidote againſt infidelity, but a Chriſtian can.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſhews, that we ſhould not alwayes go gorgeouſly array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every day alike, this was the ſinne of the glutton, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19. but <hi>Solomon</hi> was not alwayes in all his glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Since our Saviour ſets down our labour, <hi>ſpinning,</hi> &amp;c. as a help to our faith, it tacitly approves of our uſing means: and though there be ſome gallants that neither toil nor ſpin, and yet <hi>Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like one of them,</hi> yet we are to uſe ſome lawfull calling, though not to ſupply our temporal wants, yet that we may be more able to relieve others, and to preſerve our ſelves from the temptations of idleneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Solomon</hi> is named for two reaſons, 1. Becauſe he was the richeſt. 2. The wiſeſt: his riches enabled him for the matter of his garments, and his wiſdom for the artifice of them, to have the exacteſt in the world.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. It is of little uſe, for <hi>it is caſt into the oven;</hi> then we muſt conſider, though it be thus mean, how much God does for it, 1. He clothes it. 2. He ſo clothes it.</p>
                  <p>And the Argument ſtands thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of you, <hi>You are far better then the Lilies.</hi> And</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Our Saviour doth not ſay, that you have but little faith, <hi>O ye of little faith!</hi> but doth ſay that it is ſo little that it would make man ſtand admired.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The Heathen do not ſinne in ſeeking for theſe things, but firſt in ſeeking them ſo earneſtly, as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This is another reaſon why we ſhould not take care for theſe things, and it ſtands thus, If ſo be that God knows all your wants, and is able to relieve them, and willing to ſupply them; you need not take ſuch care, but he knows that we ſtand in need of theſe things, and is willing to relieve us, becauſe he is

                  </p>
                  <p>Publick judicature is not here condemned, but private cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and that in two things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the judging others to be guilty for doing thoſe things which the Law forbad not, when they judge men to be guilty for omitting their traditions and ceremonies, which were but inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, which <hi>Paul</hi> hints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. So alſo <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11. the meaning is this, He that judgeth and condemneth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for doing that which the Law forbids not, condemneth the Law of imperfection, as if the Law had not forbidden all that was to be forbidden or commanded. To break the Law may be an act of impotency, but to judge an act of arrogance, ſo that judging here and condemning may thus differ, he may be ſaid ſinfully to judge another who condemneth him for doing that which though he did he ſinneth not in doing, and he may be ſaid to condemn another ſinfully whom the Law condemneth for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he hath no juſt grounds to conclude that he did, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially raſh and uncharitable judging of perſons is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All cenſuring is forbid:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the matter, when we judge things that are doubtfull to be certain, that are ſmall ſins to be great ſins, that are indifferent to be ſinfull, or thoſe that are ſinfull to lay greater aggravation upon them then in <hi>hypotheſi</hi> belongs to them,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119918:96"/>to judge the intentions of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The reaſon is, that howſoever we carry our ſelves to others, we muſt expect the ſame meaſure from men, for ſo <hi>Luke,</hi> though we may not exclude Gods judging of us alſo.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Is it meaſured to every one according as they meaſured to others, and thoſe that are moſt holy ſhould be leaſt cenſured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. This hath a tendency to it, if wicked men will judge ſo, they go diametrically oppoſite to that which the carriage of the righteous enclines them unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Certainly as to God, this will come to paſſe that God will deal to every man according as he deals to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the grounds and rice from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <hi>viz.</hi> to Judge others out of envy, malice, pride, or from vanity of wit, when we are ſubject to ſhew our wit in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others faults.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the manner, when we do it raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, uncompaſſionately, not out of hatred of the ſinne, but of the perſon, and not that others or he may be edified, but that he may be diſgraced.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of the end, when it is done not to edification, as brotherly reproof. Or ſecondly, to make our ſelves ſeem more holy by the detecting the faults of others, as if we were vertuous, becauſe others are vicious.</p>

                     <hi>Why beholdeſt]</hi> 1. We muſt conſider why we behold the more in our brothers eye, and we ſhall finde a great deal of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the core; the <hi>Why</hi> of hypocrites words and works are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, while their outſide is ſpecious; hence that of <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. Is it the love of thy brother? Not ſo, for then thou wouldſt more hate it in thy ſelf then in others, for the love of our ſelves is to be the rule of our love of our neighbours. Is it the honour of God that troubles thee? then thou wouldeſt be more offended at a beam then a more. Is it the filthineſſe of ſin? he that hates uncleanneſſe hates it moſt the nearer it is to him,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119918:97"/>he hates uncleanneſſe in his houſe, more in his chamber, more in his face, but thou art more troubled at a more in thy brothers eye, then a beam in thy own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold]</hi> 1. There is no ſuch reaſon thou ſhouldeſt wonder that there is a mote in thy brothers eye. When thou ſeeſt a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, thou haſt more reaſon to wonder that thou art not worſe, then that he is ſo bad.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou ſhouldeſt rather weep for, and cover thy brothers faults, then ſtand gazing on them.</p>
                  <p>The word doth as well ſignifie to take heed to or care of, as to <hi>behold,</hi> Col. 4.17. the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ſo it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſignifie here, for preſently after our Saviour brings him in as taking care to pull out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mote]</hi> 1. Hypocrites are curious in diſcerning the faults of others, though one hath but one fault, it is not motes but more, and that a very ſmall one, for it is not a beam but more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They behold the faults, never look upon the graces of their brethren, a mote can ſcarce cover a conſiderable part of the eye, but they look upon the mote and not the eye.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They look upon others ſins but not upon their repentance, a mote in the eye will make it weep, but hypocrites take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the tears but of the ſinne; thou ſeeſt thy brothers ſinne, but thou knoweſt nor his ſighs and groans, nor tears in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. <hi>David</hi> defiles his bed, but he waſheth his couch with his tears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brothers cye]</hi> 1. He being thy brother thy brotherly love ſhould cover a multitude of ſin.</p>
                  <p>It may be the reaſon why our Saviour names the word <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is becauſe that thoſe that generally ſpeak ill of others, uſe to pretend a great deal of friendſhip and love, and then adde their ſlander, which like an Antidote given with poiſon makes it more deadly, and upon the point it ſhews, that thoſe that do ſo, do but diſſemble, for if thou loveſt him as a brother, how comeſt thou to diſcover one ſmall fault when thou coverſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But conſidereſt not]</hi> 1. This is one miſchief of prying into anothers fault, that one diſcerns not his own; he that is ſo much abroad muſt needs be a ſtranger at home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beam]</hi> 1. Thou art worſe then he, becauſe his is but a more, thine a beam.</p>

                  <p>One ſpecial uſe we ſhould make of anothers vice, to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves of greater, it may be he ſins not againſt ſo much means, ſo many mercies, ſo that that very ſinne which is but a mote in his eye, is a beam in thine.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Hath every one that ſpies a mote in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye a beam in his own?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Such as are outragious under reproofs, and flie in the face of the reprover, and then it runs parallel with that of <hi>Solomon, Reprove not a ſcorner.</hi> Then the obſervations are,</p>

                     <hi>What man is there,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. Our Saviour proves <hi>à fortiori,</hi> that God will give good things unto his children, and it ſtands thus, If you that are evil, that are creatures, and ſo infinitely inferiour to God, but that are wicked men, and ſo inferiour to man in his innocency; if you account it motive enough to know the wants of your children, and what is good for them, much more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is ſome natural good remains in all.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119918:99"/>ſhould ſay, When they ask you bread, you will give it them, but you will be ſure not to give that which ſhall miſchief them; if there be any ſo unnatural amongſt you, that when your ſonne asks a fiſh, if he will not give him a fiſh, ſurely he will not give him a ſcorpion: Now thus ſtands the caſe between you and your heavenly Father, that if he ſhould not give his Spirit to them that ask him, they muſt needs have the evil ſpirit, for there is no <hi>medium,</hi> whoſoever hath not the one muſt needs have the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the redition of the <hi>ſimile,</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, <hi>How much more ſhall be not give good things to his children,</hi> but <hi>to them that ask him,</hi> to ſhew that all that are frequent in that duty are his children.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is not ſaid, that God alwayes gives the very thing we ask, for ſometimes it is not good for us, or not ſo good for us as that which he gives us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. for ſometimes we ask a ſtone and he gives us bread, ſometimes a ſerpent, and he gives us a fiſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, See the wonderfull liberality of God, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He gives freely, only for asking.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He gives that which is good.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe no one almoſt doth juſtifie and plead for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, for drunkards almoſt are come to that impudence as to tell you that you muſt be drunk, but all hereticks lay it on your conſcience to believe their errours, and they doe not only preach it for a truth, but generally for a fundamental truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the ſubtilty of deceivers; prophane perſons are not comparably ſo wiſe in their generations as hereticks are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prophaneneſſe is generally more dangerous to infect thoſe that ſcarely have any ſhadow of religion in their life; but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies mainly Gods people; prophaneneſſe is amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but hereſies in the Church; therefore that may be one reaſon why falſe prophets are called wolves, becauſe their drift is to deſtroy ſheep.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no calling under heaven ſo excellent, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath ſome of his agents that profeſſe it. We reade of falſe prophets, falſe apoſtles, falſe Chriſts, and thoſe that pretended to be gods that were not Gods.</p>

                  <p>Some make their ſheeps cloathing to be only their fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as the Papiſts ſay, when they go about to ſeduce: now it is pity ſuch an one, of ſuch parts, ſhould go to hell for want of knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Some make their <hi>fruits</hi> to be their doctrine: but it is ſafeſt to take in both, for though it be generally true to ſay, that thoſe that come unto us before they be ſent, do generally preach er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, yet the full meaning of the Text may be this, Let men come to you with never ſuch fair pretences, telling you how much they love you, and what care they have of your ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet you muſt take heed that their fair words deceive you not, look to their doctrines not their pretences.</p>
                  <p>So for their converſations it may be you cannot know them, by one or two obſervations, yet by much obſervation you may, for generally hereticks are wicked men, and errours end in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of judging by bloſſoms, for then the thorn will be more glorious that way then the vine.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. The Queſtion may be, Why the Evangeliſt takes ſuch ſpecial notice, that the people were aſtoniſhed, becauſe he ſpoke as one having authority, and ſeems to paſſe by the matter of our Saviours Sermon, and takes notice of the manner of delivering of it, one would think rather that the Evangeliſt and the people ſhould have taken notice of the heavenlineſſe of his doctrine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the authority with which he delivered it. The reaſons may be,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſaid in reſpect of Chriſt, to ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt his preaching and all others, for whether they were Prophets, Scribes, or any others, they preach not ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively as Chriſt did, for the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> the Scribes, <hi>Thus ſaith ſuch a Rabby,</hi> &amp;c. They proved what they ſaid by the teſtimony of others, but Chriſt upon his own authority, <hi>I ſay unto you;</hi> and this was that wherein our Saviour excelled all other preachers. For the ſubſtance and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his doctrine it was wonderfull heavenly, yet for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it it had been formerly preached, but no one ever prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon their own authority before: his doctrine differed from the Prophets and all other teachings in heavenlineſſe and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but that was only in degree, but in reſpect of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative preaching it differed but in kinde.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the people; the meaning may be thus, That the Sermon of Chriſt came with ſuch authority and power upon their ſpirits, that they were fully convinced of the truth of thoſe things he preached, which conviction in any proportionable meaſure they never had experience before of, as often as they had heard the Scribes preach.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or may it not be to ſhew, that though they were aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yet it was not upon right grounds, for whoſoever is taken with the eloquence, pronunciation, or any thing elſe in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, beſides the holineſſe of the matter that is delivered, though their delight be ſpiritual in reſpect of the object; for it is the Word preached that delights them, yet in reſpect of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119918:104"/>formality of their delight, <hi>viz.</hi> the ground why they are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word preached is carnal.</p>
                  <p>And if you take the word ſo, then this reaſon of their aſtoniſhment is ſet down, that we might underſtand that this our Saviours Sermon did aſtoniſh them, yet it did not convert them.</p>
